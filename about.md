Hello. Welcome to visit my website. My name is **Chen Weixiang**, who live in Chengdu, China. Since April 2008, I have worked with different companies, including [Huawei](http://www.huawei.com/), [Tieto](www.tieto.com), [Syntronic](http://syntronic.com/) and [Ericsson](http://www.ericsson.com/). I have great passion for Telecommunication technology and Computer science, especially the Linux kernel. Actually, I'm planning to write more articles related to Linux system and Linux kernel on this website. Your visit to my website and your comments on my articles are always welcome.

You can always find me on a variety of world wild web sites, including [Linkedin](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/weixiang-chen-ba502935) and [GitHub](https://chenweixiang.github.io).
