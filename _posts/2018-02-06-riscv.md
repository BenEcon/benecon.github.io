This article introduces the free and open RISC instruction set architecture **RISC-V**.

# Overview

**RISC-V** (pronounced *risk-five*) is an open instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles.

In contrast to most ISAs, the RISC-V ISA can be freely used for any purpose, permitting anyone to design, manufacture and sell RISC-V chips and software. While not the first open ISA, it is significant because it is designed to be useful in modern computerized devices such as warehouse-scale cloud computers, high-end mobile phones and the smallest embedded systems. **Such uses demand that the designers consider both performance and power efficiency**. The instruction set also has a substantial body of supporting software, which fixes a usual weakness of new instruction sets.

The project began in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley, but many contributors are volunteers and industry workers outside the university.

**The RISC-V ISA has been designed with small, fast, and low-power real-world implementations in mind**, but without *over-architecting* for a particular microarchitecture style.

# RISC-V Specifications

As of May 2017, **version 2.2** of the user-space ISA is fixed and the privileged ISA is available as draft **version 1.10**.
