# What's Graphviz?

[**Graphviz**](http://www.graphviz.org/) is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains.

## Layout Commands

The following layout commands are available when Graphviz is installed:

|   Commands   | Description |
| :----------: | :---------- |
| ```dot```    | *hierarchical* or layered drawings of directed graphs. This is the default tool to use if edges have directionality. |
| ```neato```  | *spring model* layouts. This is the default tool to use if the graph is not too large (about 100 nodes) and you don't know anything else about it. Neato attempts to minimize a global energy function, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling. |
| ```fdp```    | *spring model* layouts similar to those of neato, but does this by reducing forces rather than working with energy. |
| ```sfdp```   | multiscale version of fdp for the layout of large graphs. |
| ```twopi```  | radial layouts, after Graham Wills 97. Nodes are placed on concentric circles depending their distance from a given root node. |
| ```circo```  | circular layout, after Six and Tollis 99, Kauffman and Wiese 02. This is suitable for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures, such as certain telecommunications networks. |

<p/>

```

## Editor

The editor **vimdot** is included in Graphviz:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ which vimdot
/usr/bin/vimdot
```

The [Graphviz dot mode for emacs](http://ppareit.github.io/graphviz-dot-mode/) is also a useful tool for edit Graphvize.

# Command-line Syntax

All Graphviz programs have a similar invocation:

```
cmd [ flags ] [ input files ]
```

If no input files are supplied, the program reads from **stdin**.

## Flags

* **-G***name[=value]*

    Set a graph attribute, with default value ```= true```.

* **-N***name[=value]*

    Set a default [node attribute](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes), with default value ```= true```.

* **-E***name[=value]*

    Set a default [edge attribute](http://www.graphviz.org/content/arrow-shapes), with default value ```= true```.

* **-K***layout*

    Specifies which default [layout algorithm](#layout-commands) to use, overriding the default from the command name. For example, running ```dot -Kneato``` is equivalent to running **neato**.

* **-T***format[:renderer[:formatter]]*

    Set output language to one of the [supported formats](http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats). By default, [attributed dot](http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#ddot) is produced.

    Depending on how Graphviz was built, there may be multiple *renderers* for generating a particular output format, and multiple *formatters* for creating the final output. For example, a typical installation can produce [PNG](http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#dpng) output using either the Cairo or GD library. The desired rendering engine can be specified after a colon. If there are multiple formatting engines available, the desired one can be specified in a similar fashion after the rendering engine. Thus, ```-Tpng:cairo``` specifies PNG output produced by Cairo (using the Cairo's default formatter), and ```-Tpng:cairo:gd``` specifies PNG output produced by Cairo formatted using the GD library.

    If no *renderer* is specified, or a renderer but no *formatter*, the default one is invoked. The flag ```-Tformat:``` produces a list of all of the renderers available for the specified format, the first one listed with a prefix matching format being the default. Using the ```-v``` flag will print which *format*, *renderer*, and *formatter* are actually used.

* **-l***library*

    User-supplied, device-dependent library text. Multiple flags may be given. These strings are passed to the code generator at the beginning of output.

    For PostScript output, they are treated as file names whose content will be included in the preamble after the standard preamble. If *library* is the empty string ```""```, the standard preamble is not emitted.

* **-n***[num]*

    Sets no-op flag in **neato**. If set, **neato** assumes nodes have already been positioned and all nodes have a [pos](http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs#dpos) attribute giving the positions. It then performs an optional adjustment to remove node-node overlap, depending on the value of the [overlap](http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs#doverlap) attribute, computes the edge layouts, depending on the value of the [splines](http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs#dsplines) attribute, and emits the graph in the appropriate format. If num is supplied, the following actions occur:

    * num = 1

        Equivalent to -n.

    * num > 1

        Use node positions as specified, with no adjustment to remove node-node overlaps, and use any edge layouts already specified by the pos attribute. neato computes an edge layout for any edge that does not have a [pos](http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs#dpos) attribute. As usual, edge layout is guided by the splines attribute.

* **-o***outfile*

    Write output to file *outfile*. By default, output goes to **stdout**.

* **-O**

    Automatically generate output file names based on the input file name and the various output formats specified by the ```-T``` flags.

* **-P**

    Automatically generate a graph that shows the plugin configuration of the current executable. e.g. ```dot -P -Tps | lpr```

* **-q**

    Suppress warning messages.

* **-s***[scale]*

    Set input scale to *scale*. If this value is omitted, **72.0** is used. This number is used to convert the point coordinate units used in the [pos](http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs#dpos) attribute into inches, which is what is expected by **neato** and **fdp**. Thus, feeding the output of a graph laid out by one program into **neato** or **fdp** almost always requires this flag. Ignored if the ```-n``` flag is used.

* **-V**

    Emit version information and exit.

* **-v**

    Verbose mode

* **-x**

    In **neato**, on input, prune isolated nodes and peninsulas. This removes uninteresting graph structure and produces a less cluttered drawing.

* **-y**

    By default, the coordinate system used in generic output formats, such as [attributed dot](http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#ddot), [extended dot](http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#dxdot), [plain](http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#dplain) and [plain-ext](http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#dplain-ext), is the standard cartesian system with the origin in the lower left corner, and with increasing y coordinates as points move from bottom to top. If the ```-y``` flag is used, the coordinate system is inverted, so that increasing values of y correspond to movement from top to bottom.

* **-?**

    Print usage information, then exit.

If multiple ```-T``` flags are given, drawings of the graph are emitted in each of the specified formats. Multiple ```-o``` flags can be used to specify the output file for each format. If there are more formats than files, the remaining formats are written to **stdout**.

Note that the ```-G```, ```-N``` and ```-E``` flags override any initial attribute declarations in the input graph, i.e., those attribute statements appearing before any node, edge or subgraph definitions. In addition, these flags cause the related attributes to be permanently attached to the graph. Thus, if attributed dot is used for output, the graph will have these attributes.

## Environment Variables

* **GDFONTPATH**

    List of pathnames giving directories which a program should search for fonts. Overridden by **DOTFONTPATH**. Used only if Graphviz is not built with the *fontconfig* library.

* **DOTFONTPATH**

    List of pathnames giving directories which a program should search for fonts. Overridden by **fontpath**. Used only if Graphviz is not built with the *fontconfig* library.

* **SERVER_NAME**

    If defined, this indicates that the software is running as a web application, which restricts access to image files. See **GV_FILE_PATH**.

* **GV_FILE_PATH**

    If **SERVER_NAME** is defined, image files are restricted to exist in one of the directories specified by **GV_FILE_PATH**. This last is a list of directory pathnames, separated by semicolons in Windows or by colons otherwise. Note that sometimes, when using one of the layout programs in a web script, it is not enough to use an export command but rather the variables should be set when the command is run, for example:

    ```
    SERVER_NAME=xxx GV_FILE_PATH="images:etc/images:/usr/share/images" dot -Tpng -o x.png x.gv
    ```

    Note that the image files must really reside in one of the specified directories. If the image file is specified as an absolute or relative pathname, a warning is given and only the base name is used.

* **GVBINDIR**

    Indicates which directory contains the Graphviz config file and plug-in libraries. If it is defined, the value overrides any other mechanism for finding this directory. If Graphviz is properly installed, it should not be needed, though it can be useful for relocation on platforms not running Linux or Windows.

# DOT Language

The [**DOT Language**](http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language) is a plain text graph description language. It is a simple way of describing graphs that both humans and computer programs can use. DOT graphs are typically files that end with the *.gv* (or *.dot*) extension. The *.gv* extension is preferred in cases where there could be confusion with the *.dot* file extension used by early (pre-2007) versions of Microsoft Word.

```
     graph : [ strict ] (graph | digraph) [ ID ] '{' stmt_list '}'
 stmt_list : [ stmt [ ';' ] stmt_list ]
      stmt : node_stmt | edge_stmt | attr_stmt | ID '=' ID | subgraph

 attr_stmt : (graph | node | edge) attr_list
 attr_list : '[' [ a_list ] ']' [ attr_list ]
    a_list : ID '=' ID [ (';' | ',') ] [ a_list ]

 edge_stmt : (node_id | subgraph) edgeRHS [ attr_list ]
   edgeRHS : edgeop (node_id | subgraph) [ edgeRHS ]

 node_stmt : node_id [ attr_list ]
   node_id : ID [ port ]
      port : ':' ID [ ':' compass_pt ] | ':' compass_pt
compass_pt : (n | ne | e | se | s | sw | w | nw | c | _)

  subgraph : [ subgraph [ ID ] ] '{' stmt_list '}'
```

The keywords **node**, **edge**, **graph**, **digraph**, **subgraph**, and **strict** are case-independent. Note also that the allowed compass point values are not keywords, so these strings can be used elsewhere as ordinary identifiers and, conversely, the parser will actually accept any identifier.

An ID is one of the following:

* Any string of alphabetic (```[a-zA-Z\200-\377]```) characters, underscores (```_```) or digits (```[0-9]```), not beginning with a digit;
* a numeral ```[-]?(.[0-9]+ | [0-9]+(.[0-9]*)?)```;
* any double-quoted string (```"..."```) possibly containing escaped quotes (``` ' ```);
* an HTML string (```<...>```).

An ID is just a string; the lack of quote characters in the first two forms is just for simplicity. There is no semantic difference between ```abc_2``` and ```"abc_2"```, or between ```2.34``` and ```"2.34"```. Obviously, to use a keyword as an ID, it must be quoted. Note that, in HTML strings, angle brackets must occur in matched pairs, and newlines and other formatting whitespace characters are allowed. In addition, the content must be legal XML, so that the special XML escape sequences for ```"```, ```&```, ```<```, and ```>``` may be necessary in order to embed these characters in attribute values or raw text. As an ID, an HTML string can be any legal XML string. However, if used as a label attribute, it is interpreted specially and must follow the syntax for [HTML-like labels](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes#html).

Both quoted strings and HTML strings are scanned as a unit, so any embedded comments will be treated as part of the strings.

An *edgeop* is ```->``` in directed graphs and ```--``` in undirected graphs.

The language supports C++-style comments: ```/* */``` and ```//```. In addition, a line beginning with a ```'#'``` character is considered a line output from a C preprocessor (e.g., # 34 to indicate line 34 ) and discarded.

Semicolons and commas aid readability but are not required. Also, any amount of whitespace may be inserted between terminals.

As another aid for readability, dot allows double-quoted strings to span multiple physical lines using the standard C convention of a backslash immediately preceding a newline character2. In addition, double-quoted strings can be concatenated using a '+' operator. As HTML strings can contain newline characters, which are used solely for formatting, the language does not allow escaped newlines or concatenation operators to be used within them.

## Digraph or Graph

A graph must be specified as either a **digraph** (有向图) or a **graph** (无向图). Semantically, this indicates whether or not there is a natural direction from one of the edge's nodes to the other. Lexically, a **digraph** must specify an edge using the edge operator ```->``` while a undirected **graph** must use ```--```. Operationally, the distinction is used to define different default rendering attributes. For example, edges in a digraph will be drawn, by default, with an arrowhead pointing to the head node. For ordinary graphs, edges are drawn without any arrowheads by default.

The attributes can be found on [Node, Edge and Graph Attributes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html).

### Digraph

Save the following script to *test_digraph.gv*:

```
digraph test_digraph
{
    graph[bgcolor="cadetblue" label="Digraph" fontsize=24 fontcolor="green"];

    a -> b -> c
    b -> d
}
```

Then, run the following command to create *test_digraph.gv.png*:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ dot -Tpng -O test_digraph.gv
```

![test_digraph.gv.png](/assets/test_digraph.gv.png)

### Graph

A **graph** may also be described as **strict**. This forbids the creation of multi-edges, i.e., there can be at most one edge with a given tail node and head node in the directed case. For undirected graphs, there can be at most one edge connected to the same two nodes. Subsequent edge statements using the same two nodes will identify the edge with the previously defined one and apply any attributes given in the edge statement. For example, the following graph will have a single edge connecting nodes a and b, whose color is blue.

Save the following script to *test_digraph.gv*:

```
strict graph test_graph
{
    graph[bgcolor="cadetblue" label="Graph" fontsize=24 fontcolor="green"];

    a -- b
    a -- b
    b -- a [color=blue]
}
```

Then, run the following command to create *test_graph.gv.png*:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ dot -Tpng -O test_graph.gv
```

![test_graph.gv.png](/assets/test_graph.gv.png)

## Node

There are three main types of shapes: **polygon-based**, **record-based** and **user-defined**. The **record-based** shape has largely been superseded and greatly generalized by [HTML-like labels](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes#html). That is, instead of using *shape=record*, one might consider using *shape=none, margin=0* and an [HTML-like label](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes#html).

The geometry and style of all node shapes are affected by the node attributes *fixedsize*, *fontname*, *fontsize*, *height*, *label*, *style* and *width*.

### Polygon-based Nodes

Save the following script to *test_polygon.gv*:

```
digraph test_polygon_based_node
{
    node1 [shape=ellipse, label="Ellipse\nNode"];
    node2 [shape=parallelogram, label="Parallelogram\nNode", color="green"];
    node3 [shape=circle, label="Circle\nNode", style=filled, fillcolor="yellow"];

    node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
```

Then, run the following command to create *test_polygon.gv.png*:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ dot -Tpng -O test_polygon.gv
```

![test_polygon.gv.png](/assets/test_polygon.gv.png)

The polygon-based nodes can be found on [Polygon-based Nodes](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes#polygon).
The attributes can be found on [Node, Edge and Graph Attributes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html).

### Record-based Nodes

Save the following script to *test_record.gv*:

```
digraph test_record_based_node
{
    node [shape=record];
    struct1 [label="<f0> left|<f1> mid&#92; dle|<f2> right"];
    struct2 [label="<f0> one|<f1> two"];
    struct3 [label="hello&#92;nworld |{ b |{c|<here> d|e}| f}| g | h"];

    struct1:f1 -> struct2:f0;
    struct1:f2 -> struct3:here;
}
```

Then, run the following command to create *test_record.gv.png*:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ dot -Tpng -O test_record.gv
```

![test_record.gv.png](/assets/test_record.gv.png)

The record-based nodes can be found on [Record-based Nodes](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes#record).
The attributes can be found on [Node, Edge and Graph Attributes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html).

### User-defined Nodes

The user-defined nodes can be found on [User-defined Nodes](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes#epsf).
The attributes can be found on [Node, Edge and Graph Attributes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html).

## Edge

Save the following script to *test_edge.gv*:

```
digraph test_edge
{
    style0[label="Shape Examples"];
    style1[label=""] style2[label=""] style3[label=""] style4[label=""];

    style0 -> style1 [style=solid, label="Solid"];
    style1 -> style2 [style=solid, label="Bolid"];
    style2 -> style3 [style=dashed, label="Dashed"];
    style3 -> style4 [style=dotted, label="Dotted"];

    arrow0[label="Arrow Examples"];
    arrow1[label=""] arrow2[label=""] arrow3[label=""] arrow4[label=""] arrow5[label=""] arrow6[label=""];
    arrow0 -> arrow1 [dir=both, label="Both"];
    arrow1 -> arrow2 [arrowsize=2.0, label="Big"];
    arrow2 -> arrow3 [arrowhead="open", label="Open"];
    arrow3 -> arrow4 [arrowhead="halfopen", label="Halfopen"];
    arrow4 -> arrow5 [arrowhead="ediamond", label="Ediamond"];
    arrow5 -> arrow6 [arrowhead="dot", label="Dot"];

    color0[label="Color Examples"];
    color1[label=""] color2[label=""] color3[label=""];
    color0 -> color1 [color="blue", label="Blue"];
    color1 -> color2 [color="red:blue", label="Red:Blue"];
    color2 -> color3 [color="green:red;0.4:blue", label="Green:Red:Blue"];
}
```

Then, run the following command to create *test_edge.gv.png*:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ dot -Tpng -O test_edge.gv
```

![test_edge.gv.png](/assets/test_edge.gv.png)

The attributes can be found on [Node, Edge and Graph Attributes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html).
