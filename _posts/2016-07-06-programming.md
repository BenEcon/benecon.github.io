# Overview

A programming language is a formal computer language or constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

# Types of Programming Languages

According to [Classifying Programming Languages](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/pltypes/), different languages have different purposes, so it makes sense to talk about different kinds, or types, of languages. Some types are:

* **Machine languages** - interpreted directly in hardware
* **Assembly languages** - thin wrappers over a corresponding machine language
* **High-level languages** - anything machine-independent
* **System languages** - designed for writing low-level tasks, like memory and process management
* **Scripting languages** - generally extremely high-level and powerful
* **Domain-specific languages** - used in highly special-purpose areas only
* **Visual languages** - non-text based
* **Esoteric languages** - not really intended to be used

**These types are not mutually exclusive**: **Perl** is both high-level and scripting; **C** is considered both high-level and system.
