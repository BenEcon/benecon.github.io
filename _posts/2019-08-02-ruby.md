# Overview

According to [Official Ruby FAQ](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/faq/1/), Ruby is a simple and powerful object-oriented programming language, created by *Yukihiro Matsumoto* (who goes by the handle *Matz* in the document and on the mailing lists).

Like Perl, Ruby is good at text processing. Like Smalltalk, everything in Ruby is an object, and Ruby has blocks, iterators, meta-classes and other good stuff.

You can use Ruby to write servers, experiment with prototypes, and for everyday programming tasks. As a fully-integrated object-oriented language, Ruby scales well.

Ruby features:

* Simple syntax,
* Basic OO features (classes, methods, objects, and so on),
* Special OO features (mixins, singleton methods, renaming, and so on),
* Operator overloading,
* Exception handling,
* Iterators and closures,
* Garbage collection,
* Dynamic loading (depending on the architecture),
* High transportability (runs on various Unices, Windows, DOS, macOS, OS/2, Amiga, and so on).
