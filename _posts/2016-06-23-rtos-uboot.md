This article introduces the universal boot loader **Das U-Boot**.

<!--more-->

# Overview

**Das U-Boot** (or just **U-Boot** for short) is an open source, primary boot loader used in embedded devices to package the instructions to boot the device's operating system kernel. It is available for a number of computer architectures, including 68k, ARM, AVR32, Blackfin, MicroBlaze, MIPS, Nios, SuperH, PPC and x86.

Das U-Boot is both a first-stage and second-stage bootloader. It is loaded by the system's ROM or BIOS from a supported boot device. These vary by platform; typical examples include SD cards, SATA, NOR flash (e.g. EEPROMs, using SPI or IÂ²C), and NAND flash. If there are size constraints, Das U-Boot may be split into stages: the platform would load a small SPL (Secondary Program Loader), and the SPL would do initial hardware configuration and load the rest of Das U-Boot.[1][2][3] Regardless of whether the SPL is used, Das U-Boot performs both first-stage (e.g., configuring memory controllers and SDRAM) and second-stage booting (performing multiple steps to load a modern operating system from a variety of devices that must be configured, presenting a menu for users to interact with and control the boot process, etc.).

# U-Boot Commands

Note that U-Boot is highly configurable, so not all of these commands may be available in the configuration of U-Boot installed on your hardware, or additional commands may exist. You can use the ```help``` command to print a list of all available commands for your configuration.

For most commands, you do not need to type in the full command name; instead it is sufficient to type a few characters. For instance, ```help``` can be abbreviated as ```h```.

* The behaviour of some commands depends on the configuration of U-Boot and on the definition of some variables in your U-Boot environment.
* Almost all U-Boot commands expect numbers to be entered in hexadecimal input format. (Exception: for historical reasons, the ```sleep``` command takes its argument in decimal input format.)
* Be careful not to use edit keys besides *Backspace*, as hidden characters in things like environment variables can be very difficult to find.

Refer to [DENX U-Boot and Linux Guide (DULG)](http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Manual) and [U-Boot Command Line Interface](http://www.denx.de/wiki/view/DULG/UBootCommandLineInterface) for more details about U-Boot commands.

```
=> help help
help - print online help

Usage:
help [command ...]
    - show help information (for 'command')
'help' prints online help for the monitor commands.

Without arguments, it prints a short usage message for all commands.

To get detailed help information for specific commands you can type
'help' with one or more command names as arguments.

# Port U-Boot to a New Platform

Refer to **~/u-boot/README**:

If the system board that you have is not listed, then you will need to port U-Boot to your hardware platform. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Create a new directory to hold your board specific code. Add any files you need. In your board directory, you will need at least the **Makefile** and a **\<board\>.c**.
2. Create a new configuration file **include/configs/\<board\>.h** for your board.
3. If you're porting U-Boot to a new CPU, then also create a new directory to hold your CPU specific code. Add any files you need.
4. Run **make \<board\>_defconfig** with your new name.
5. Type **make**, and you should get a working **u-boot.srec** file to be installed on your target system.
6. Debug and solve any problems that might arise. Of course, this last step is much harder than it sounds.
