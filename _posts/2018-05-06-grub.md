This article introduces the GNU GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader).

<!--more-->

# Overview

[GNU GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/index.html) is a [Multiboot](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html) boot loader. It was derived from **GRUB**, the **GRand Unified Bootloader**, which was originally designed and implemented by *Erich Stefan Boleyn*.

Briefly, a boot loader is the first software program that runs when a computer starts. It is responsible for loading and transferring control to the operating system kernel software (such as the [Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html) or Linux). The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of the operating system (e.g. GNU).

# GRUB Development

**GRUB 2** has replaced what was formerly known as GRUB (i.e. version 0.9x), which has, in turn, become [GRUB Legacy](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy.html). Enhancements to GRUB are still being made, but the current released versions are quite usable for normal operation.

[GRUB Legacy](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy.html) **is no longer being developed**. For the differences between GRUB Legacy and GRUB, see the [Grub Legacy Documentation](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy-support.html).

**GRUB 2** is now available via [FTP](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/grub), or Git:

```
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/grub.git
```
