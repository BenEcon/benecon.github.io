# History

The following table shows some of the important events in the rollout of the GSM system.

| Years | Events |
| :---: | :----- |
| 1982  | Conference of European Posts and Telegraph (CEPT) establishes a GSM group to widen the standards for a pan-European cellular mobile system. |
| 1985  | A list of recommendations to be generated by the group is accepted. |
| 1986  | Executed field tests to check the different radio techniques recommended for the air interface. |
| 1987  | Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is chosen as the access method (with Frequency Division Multiple Access [FDMA]). The initial Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed by telecommunication operators representing 12 countries. |
| 1988  | GSM system is validated. |
| 1989  | The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) was given the responsibility of the GSM specifications. |
| 1990  | **Phase 1** of the GSM specifications is delivered. |
| **1991**  | **Commercial launch of the GSM service occurs**. The DCS1800 specifications are finalized. |
| 1992  | The addition of the countries that signed the GSM MoU takes place. Coverage spreads to larger cities and airports. |
| 1993  | Coverage of main roads GSM services starts outside Europe. |
| 1994  | Data transmission capabilities launched. The number of networks rises to 69 in 43 countries by the end of 1994. |
| 1995  | **Phase 2** of the GSM specifications occurs. Coverage is extended to rural areas. |
| 1996  | June: 133 network in 81 countries operational. |
| 1997  | July: 200 network in 109 countries operational, around 44 million subscribers worldwide. |
| 1999  | Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) came into existence and became operational in 130 countries with 260 million subscribers. |
| **2000**  | **General Packet Radio Service** (**GPRS**) came into existence. |
| 2001  | As of May 2001, over 550 million people were subscribers to mobile telecommunications. |
| 2002  | The first Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) were introduced and the first GSM network in the 800 MHz frequency band became operational. |
| 2003  | Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) services first became operational in a network. |
| 2004  | The number of worldwide GSM subscribers exceeded 1 billion. |
| 2015  | Macau planned to phase out its 2G GSM networks as of June 4, 2015, making it the first region to decommission a GSM network. |

#### Channel Mapping

The following figure shows the channel mapping of logical channels, transport channels and physical channels:

# Mobile Station (MS)

The MT plus any TE constitutes the Mobile Station (MS). That's: **MS = MT + TE**.

The following figure is **Figure 1: PLMN Access Reference Configuration (in A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode)** from **TS 24.002-810 PLMN Access Reference Configuration**:

![R8_PLMN_Access_Reference_Configuration_in_A-Gb_mode_and_GERAN_Iu_mode](/assets/R8_PLMN_Access_Reference_Configuration_in_A-Gb_mode_and_GERAN_Iu_mode.png)

There are two types of MT:

* **MT0** includes functions belonging to the functional group MT, with support of no terminal interfaces.

# GSM Core Network (MAP)

MAP for GSM (prior to Release 4) is specified by 3GPP **TS 09.02** (MAP v1, MAP v2).

# GSM Technical Details

The following GSM technical detail is from [GSM Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/gsm/).

**Modulation**

Modulation is the process of transforming the input data into a suitable format for the transmission medium. The transmitted data is demodulated back to its original form at the receiving end. The GSM uses **Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying** (**GMSK**) modulation method. Refer to **3GPP TS 45.004 Modulation**.

**Access Methods**

Radio spectrum being a limited resource that is consumed and divided among all the users, GSM devised a combination of TDMA/FDMA as the method to divide the bandwidth among the users. In this process, the FDMA part divides the frequency of the total 25 MHz bandwidth into 124 carrier frequencies of 200 kHz bandwidth.

Each BS is assigned with one or multiple frequencies, and each of this frequency is divided into eight timeslots using a TDMA scheme. Each of these slots are used for both transmission as well as reception of data. These slots are separated by time so that a mobile unit doesn't transmit and receive data at the same time.

Refer to **3GPP TS 45.002 Multiplexing and multiple access on the radio path**.

**Transmission Rate**

The total symbol rate for GSM at 1 bit per symbol in GMSK produces 270.833 K symbols/second. The gross transmission rate of a timeslot is 22.8 Kbps.

GSM is a digital system with an over-the-air bit rate of **270 kbps**.

**Frequency Band**

The uplink frequency range specified for GSM is 933 - 960 MHz (basic 900 MHz band only). The downlink frequency band 890 - 915 MHz (basic 900 MHz band only). Refer to **3GPP TS 45.005 Radio transmission and reception**.

**Channel Spacing**

Channel spacing indicates the spacing between adjacent carrier frequencies. For GSM, it is **200 kHz**. Refer to **3GPP TS 45.005 Radio transmission and reception**.

**Duplex Distance**

Duplex distance is the space between the uplink and downlink frequencies. The duplex distance for GSM is 80 MHz, where each channel has two frequencies that are 80 MHz apart. Refer to **TS 45.005 Radio transmission and reception**.

**Speech Coding**

For speech coding or processing, GSM uses **Linear Predictive Coding** (**LPC**). This tool compresses the bit rate and gives an estimate of the speech parameters. When the audio signal passes through a filter, it mimics the vocal tract. Here, the speech is encoded at **13 kbps**.

**GSM Services**

GSM offers three basic types of services:

* Telephony services or teleservices
* Data services or bearer services
* Supplementary services

# GPRS (2.5G)

General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data service on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system's Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). GPRS was originally standardized by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

GPRS is a best-effort service, implying variable throughput and latency that depend on the number of other users sharing the service concurrently, as opposed to circuit switching, where a certain Quality of Service (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection. In 2G systems, GPRS provides data rates of 56–114 kbit/second. 2G cellular technology combined with GPRS is sometimes described as **2.5G**, that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is integrated into GSM **Release 97** and newer releases.

Based on specifications in Release 97, GPRS typically reached speeds of **40Kbps** in the downlink and **14Kbps** in the uplink by aggregating GSM time slots into one bearer. Enhancements in **R98** and **R99** meant that GPRS could theoretically reach downlink speeds of up to **171Kbps**.

# EDGE / EGPRS (2.75G)

**Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution** (**EDGE**), also known as **Enhanced GPRS** (**EGPRS**), is a digital mobile phone technology that allows improved data transmission rates as a backward-compatible extension of GSM. EDGE is considered a pre-3G radio technology and is part of ITU's 3G definition. EDGE was deployed on GSM networks beginning in 2003 - initially by Cingular (now AT&T) in the United States.

EDGE is standardized also by 3GPP as part of the GSM family, which is introduced into **Release 98**. A variant, so called Compact-EDGE, was developed for use in a portion of **Digital AMPS** (**D-AMPS**) network spectrum.

Through the introduction of sophisticated methods of coding and transmitting data, EDGE delivers higher bit-rates per radio channel, resulting in a threefold increase in capacity and performance compared with an ordinary GSM/GPRS connection.

EDGE can be used for any packet switched application, such as an Internet connection.

Reading should start with the **44 series** and **45 series** of the 3GPP specifications.

## Evolved EDGE

Evolved EDGE continues in **Release 7** of the 3GPP standard providing reduced latency and more than doubled performance e.g. to complement High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA). Peak bit-rates of up to 1 Mbit/s and typical bit-rates of 400 kbit/s can be expected.

Evolved EDGE improves on EDGE in a number of ways. Latencies are reduced by lowering the Transmission Time Interval by half (from 20 ms to 10 ms). Bit rates are increased up to 1 Mbit/s peak bandwidth and latencies down to 80 ms using dual carrier, higher symbol rate and higher-order modulation (32QAM and 16QAM instead of 8PSK), and turbo codes to improve error correction. And finally signal quality is improved using dual antennas improving average bit-rates and spectrum efficiency. EDGE Evolution can be gradually introduced as software upgrades, taking advantage of the installed base. With EDGE Evolution, end-users will be able to experience mobile internet connections corresponding to a 500 kbit/s ADSL service.

EDGE Evolution has:

* Improved spectral efficiency with reduced latencies down to 100ms;
* Increased throughput speeds to **1.3Mbps** in the downlink and **653Kbps** in the uplink.
