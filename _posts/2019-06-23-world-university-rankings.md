# QS World University Rankings

According to [QS World University Rankings on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QS_World_University_Rankings):

[QS World University Rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/) is an annual publication of university rankings by *Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)*. Previously known as *Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings*, the publisher had collaborated with *Times Higher Education (THE)* magazine to publish its international league tables from 2004 to 2009 before both started to announce their own versions. *Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)* then chose to continue using the pre-existing methodology while *Times Higher Education (THE)* adopted a new methodology to create their rankings.

The *Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)* system now comprises the global overall and subject rankings (which name the world's top universities for the study of 48 different subjects and five composite faculty areas), alongside five independent regional tables (*Asia*, *Latin America*, *Emerging Europe and Central Asia*, *the Arab Region*, and *BRICS*).

Being the only international ranking to have received *International Ranking Expert Group (IREG)* approval, the QS ranking is viewed as one of the three most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. However, it has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over the years. Concern also exists regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate QS ranking results.

# THE World University Rankings

[THE (Times Higher Education)](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings) has been providing trusted performance data on universities for students and their families, university academics, university leaders, governments and industry, since 2004.

Our flagship analysis, the *THE World University Rankings*, is the definitive list of the top universities globally, including more than 1,250 institutions across 86 countries in 2019. It is the only global university league table to judge research-intensive universities across each one of their core missions:

* Teaching (the learning environment)
* Research (volume, income and reputation)
* International outlook (staff, students and research)
* Citations (research influence)
* Industry income (knowledge transfer)

It uses 13 carefully calibrated performance indicators to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons, and all data is independently audited by professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), making the THE World University Rankings the only global university rankings to be subjected to full, independent scrutiny of this nature. [The methodology is here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/methodology-world-university-rankings-2019).

Under the *THE World University Rankings* umbrella, and using the same range of performance metrics, THE also publishes a series of highly regarded regional and thematic rankings, including:

* THE Asia University Rankings
* THE Latin America University Rankings
* THE Young University Rankings

We also use this data, combined with an annual Academic Reputation Survey of 10,000 scholars around the world, to produce the *THE World Reputation Rankings* which looks at the world’s top universities based purely on their academic prestige.
