# Overview

Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by *Guido van Rossum* and first released in **1991**. As an **interpreted language**, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using *whitespace indentation* to delimit code blocks rather than *curly braces* or *keywords*), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python features a **dynamic type system** and **automatic memory management** and **supports multiple programming paradigms**, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. **CPython**, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. **CPython** is managed by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](#python-software-foundation-psf-).

## Python Releases

Refer to [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for Python releases, and [What’s New in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html) for release notes.

Refer to [Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) for the critical differences between Python 2.x and 3.x. Also refer to [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html).

According to [PEP 373: Python 2.7 Release Schedule](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/), the End Of Life date (EOL, sunset date) for Python 2.7 has been moved five years into the future, to **2020**. This decision was made to clarify the status of Python 2.7 and relieve worries for those users who cannot yet migrate to Python 3. See also [PEP 466: Network Security Enhancements for Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0466/). This declaration does not guarantee that bugfix releases will be made on a regular basis, but it should enable volunteers who want to contribute bugfixes for Python 2.7 and it should satisfy vendors who still have to support Python 2 for years to come.

According to [PEP 404: Python 2.8 Un-release Schedule](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0404/):
* There is no official Python 2.8 release. There never will be an official Python 2.8 release. It is an ex-release. Python 2.7 is the end of the Python 2 line of development.
* The official upgrade path from Python 2.7 is to Python 3.

And the [Python 2.7 Countdown](https://pythonclock.org/) shows a down counter of Python 2.7 retirement. The [moving to require Python 3](https://python3statement.org/) shows the projects that have pledged to drop support for Python 2.7 no later than 2020.

## Python Software Foundation (PSF)

The [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/) is an independent non-profit organization that holds the copyright on Python versions 2.1 and newer. The PSF’s mission is to advance open source technology related to the Python programming language and to publicize the use of Python.

## Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

Python's development is conducted largely through the **Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)** process. The PEP process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the [Python community](https://www.python.org/community/) and by *Van Rossum*, the Python project's benevolent dictator for life. Refer to [Index of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) and [Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/).

# Python Implementations

There are some alternate implementations which are of particular interest to different audiences. Refer to [Alternative Python Implementations](https://www.python.org/download/alternatives/) for more information. The known implementations include:

* **CPython**

    This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, written in **C**. New language features generally appear here first. Refer to [CPython](#cpython) for more information.

* **Jython**

    Python implemented in **Java**. This implementation can be used as a scripting language for Java applications, or can be used to create applications using the Java class libraries. It is also often used to create tests for Java libraries. More information can be found at [the Jython website](http://www.jython.org/).

* **Python for .NET**

    This implementation actually uses the **CPython** implementation, but is a managed .NET application and makes .NET libraries available. It was created by Brian Lloyd. For more information, see [the Python for .NET website](https://pythonnet.github.io/).

* **IronPython**

    An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET assemblies. It was created by *Jim Hugunin*, the original creator of **Jython**. For more information, see [the IronPython website](http://ironpython.net/).

* **PyPy**

    An implementation of Python written completely in **Python**. It supports several advanced features not found in other implementations like stackless support and a Just in Time compiler (JIT). One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation with the language itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python). Additional information is available on [the PyPy website](http://pypy.org/).

## CPython

The latest development sources of Python can be obtained at [Git Repo](https://github.com/python/cpython/):

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git
```

Directory structure of CPython source tree is listed below:

```

```

* **Doc**

    The official documentation. This is what [https://docs.python.org/](https://docs.python.org/) uses. See also [Building the documentation](https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#building-doc).

* **Grammar**

    Contains the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammar file for Python.

* **Include**

    Contains all interpreter-wide header files.

* **Lib**

    The part of the standard library implemented in pure Python.

* **Mac**

    Mac-specific code (e.g., using IDLE as an OS X application).

* **Misc**

    Things that do not belong elsewhere. Typically this is varying kinds of developer-specific documentation.

* **Modules**

    The part of the standard library (plus some other code) that is implemented in C.

* **Objects**

    Code for all built-in types.

* **PC**

    Windows-specific code.

* **PCbuild**

    Build files for the version of MSVC currently used for the Windows installers provided on python.org.

* **Parser**

    Code related to the parser. The definition of the AST nodes is also kept here.

* **Programs**

    Source code for C executables, including the main function for the CPython interpreter (in versions prior to Python 3.5, these files are in the **Modules** directory).

* **Python**

    The code that makes up the core CPython runtime. This includes the compiler, eval loop and various built-in modules.

* **Tools**

    Various tools that are (or have been) used to maintain Python.

### Building CPython

On Debian, Ubuntu, and other **apt** based systems, try to get the dependencies for the Python version that you're working on. If that package is not available for your system, try reducing the minor version until you find a package that is available.

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ sudo apt-get build-dep python3.5
```

Run the following command to build Python from source code, refer to [Getting Started section](https://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html) of [Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/) for details:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ cd cpython/

chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ git co v3.6.1
HEAD is now at 69c0db5050f6... Update docs and patchlevel for 3.6.1 final

The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
_bz2                  _lzma
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

The following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been
built by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:
atexit                pwd                   time

Failed to build these modules:

## Alternatives to Python Interpreter

One alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for quite some time is [IPython](https://ipython.org/), which features tab completion, object exploration and advanced history management. It can also be thoroughly customized and embedded into other applications.

Another similar enhanced interactive environment is [bpython](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/).

# Python Commands

## Command Options

When invoking Python, you may specify any of these options, refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html):

```
python2 [ -bBdEiOQRsStuUvVWxX3? ] [ -c command | -m module-name | script | - ] [ args ]
python3 [ -bBdEhiIOqsSuvVWx? ]    [ -c command | -m module-name | script | - ] [ args ]
```

| ```-d``` | Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on compilation options). See also [PYTHONDEBUG](#environment-variables). |
| ```-E``` | Ignore all **PYTHON\*** environment variables, e.g. **PYTHONPATH** and **PYTHONHOME**, that might be set, see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables). |
| ```-i``` | When a script is passed as first argument or the ```-c``` option is used, enter **interactive mode** after executing the script or the command, even when **sys.stdin** does not appear to be a terminal. The [PYTHONSTARTUP](#environment-variables) file is not read. This can be useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception. See also [PYTHONINSPECT](#environment-variables). |
| ```-I``` | Run Python in **isolated mode**. This also implies **-E** and **-s**. In isolated mode **sys.path** contains neither the script’s directory nor the user’s *site-packages directory*. All **PYTHON\*** environment variables are ignored too. Further restrictions may be imposed to prevent the user from injecting malicious code. *New in version 3.4*. |
| ```-O``` | Turn on basic optimizations. See also [PYTHONOPTIMIZE](#environment-variables). |
| ```-OO``` | Discard *docstrings* in addition to the **-O** optimizations. |
| ```-q``` | Don’t display the copyright and version messages even in **interactive mode**. *New in version 3.2.* |
| ```-R``` | Kept for compatibility. On Python 3.3 and greater, hash randomization is turned on by default. On previous versions of Python, this option turns on hash randomization, so that the ```__hash__()``` values of ```str```, ```bytes``` and ```datetime``` are salted with an unpredictable random value. Although they remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not predictable between repeated invocations of Python. *New in version 3.2.3*. *Changed in version 3.7*: The option is no longer ignored. |
| ```-s``` | Don’t add the user *site-packages directory* to **sys.path**, see [Python FAQ](#python-faq) and [PEP 370: Per user site-packages directory](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370/). |
| ```-S``` | Disable the import of the module [site](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html) and the site-dependent manipulations of **sys.path** that it entails. Also disable these manipulations if site is explicitly imported later (call ```site.main()``` if you want them to be triggered). |
| ```-t``` | Issue a warning when a source file mixes tabs and spaces for indentation in a way that makes it depend on the worth of a tab expressed in spaces. Issue an error when the option is given twice (```-tt```). |
| ```-u``` | Force the binary layer of the **stdout** and **stderr** streams (which is available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file. See also [PYTHONUNBUFFERED](#environment-variables). |
| ```-W arg``` | Warning control. Python’s warning machinery by default prints warning messages to **sys.stderr**. |
| ```-x``` | Skip the first line of the source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of ```#!cmd```. This is intended for a *DOS specific hack only*. |
| ```-X``` | Reserved for various implementation-specific options. |
| ```-J``` | Reserved for use by **Jython**. You shouldn’t use this option. |
| ```-3``` | Warn about Python 3.x possible incompatibilities by emitting a ```DeprecationWarning``` for features that are removed or significantly changed in Python 3 and can’t be detected using static code analysis. *New in version 2.6*. See [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/pyporting.html) for more details. |
| ```args``` | Arguments passed to program in **sys.argv[1:]**. |

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ python -V
Python 2.7.12

chenwx@chenwx ~ $ python -h
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-B     : don't write .py[co] files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : debug output from parser; also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-m mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)
-O     : optimize generated bytecode slightly; also PYTHONOPTIMIZE=x
-OO    : remove doc-strings in addition to the -O optimizations
-R     : use a pseudo-random salt to make hash() values of various types be
         unpredictable between separate invocations of the interpreter, as
         a defense against denial-of-service attacks
-Q arg : division options: -Qold (default), -Qwarn, -Qwarnall, -Qnew
-s     : don't add user site directory to sys.path; also PYTHONNOUSERSITE
-S     : don't imply 'import site' on initialization
-t     : issue warnings about inconsistent tab usage (-tt: issue errors)
-u     : unbuffered binary stdout and stderr; also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x
         see man page for details on internal buffering relating to '-u'
-v     : verbose (trace import statements); also PYTHONVERBOSE=x
         can be supplied multiple times to increase verbosity
-V     : print the Python version number and exit (also --version)
-W arg : warning control; arg is action:message:category:module:lineno
         also PYTHONWARNINGS=arg
-x     : skip first line of source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of #!cmd
-3     : warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix
file   : program read from script file
-      : program read from stdin (default; interactive mode if a tty)
arg ...: arguments passed to program in sys.argv[1:]

Other environment variables:
PYTHONSTARTUP: file executed on interactive startup (no default)
PYTHONPATH   : ':'-separated list of directories prefixed to the
               default module search path.  The result is sys.path.
PYTHONHOME   : alternate <prefix> directory (or <prefix>:<exec_prefix>).
               The default module search path uses <prefix>/pythonX.X.
PYTHONCASEOK : ignore case in 'import' statements (Windows).
PYTHONIOENCODING: Encoding[:errors] used for stdin/stdout/stderr.
PYTHONHASHSEED: if this variable is set to 'random', the effect is the same
   as specifying the -R option: a random value is used to seed the hashes of
   str, bytes and datetime objects.  It can also be set to an integer
   in the range [0,4294967295] to get hash values with a predictable seed.
```

PYTHONCASEOK : ignore case in 'import' statements (Windows).
PYTHONIOENCODING: Encoding[:errors] used for stdin/stdout/stderr.
PYTHONFAULTHANDLER: dump the Python traceback on fatal errors.

Also you can run command ```python -vv``` or ```python3 -vv``` to print a message for each file that is checked for when searching for a module.

## Environment Variables

The environment variables influence Python’s behavior, they are processed **before** the command-line switches other than ```-E``` or ```-I```. It is customary that command-line switches override environmental variables where there is a conflict. Refer to [command line and environment](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html) for details.

* **PYTHONHOME**

    Change the location of the standard Python libraries. By default, the libraries are searched in *prefix***/lib/python***version* and *exec_prefix***/lib/python***version*, where *prefix* and *exec_prefix* are installation-dependent directories, both defaulting to **/usr/local**.

    When **PYTHONHOME** is set to a single directory, its value replaces both *prefix* and *exec_prefix*. To specify different values for these, set **PYTHONHOME** to *prefix***:***exec_prefix*.

* **PYTHONPATH**

    Augment the default search path for module files. The format is the same as the shell’s **PATH**: one or more directory pathnames separated by ```os.pathsep```, e.g. colons on Unix or semicolons on Windows. Non-existent directories are silently ignored.

    In addition to normal directories, individual **PYTHONPATH** entries may refer to *zipfiles* containing pure Python modules (in either source or compiled form). Extension modules cannot be imported from *zipfiles*.

    The default search path is installation dependent, but generally begins with *prefix***/lib/python***version*, see **PYTHONHOME** above. It is always appended to **PYTHONPATH**.

    An additional directory will be inserted in the search path in front of **PYTHONPATH** as described above under *Interface options*. The search path can be manipulated from within a Python program as the variable ```sys.path```.

* **PYTHONSTARTUP**

    If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in interactive mode. The file is executed in the same namespace where interactive commands are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can be used without qualification in the interactive session. You can also change the prompts ```sys.ps1``` and ```sys.ps2``` and the hook ```sys.__interactivehook__``` in this file.

* **PYTHONOPTIMIZE**

    If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the ```-O``` option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying ```-O``` multiple times.

* **PYTHONDEBUG**

    If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the ```-d``` option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying ```-d``` multiple times.

* **PYTHONINSPECT**

    If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the ```-i``` option. This variable can also be modified by Python code using ```os.environ``` to force inspect mode on program termination.

* **PYTHONUNBUFFERED**

    If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the ```-u``` option.

* **PYTHONVERBOSE**

    If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the ```-v``` option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying ```-v``` multiple times.

* **PYTHONCASEOK**

    If this is set, Python ignores case in ```import``` statements. This only works on Windows and OS X.

* **PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE**

    If this is set to a non-empty string, Python won’t try to write **.pyc** files on the import of source modules. This is equivalent to specifying the ```-B``` option.

* **PYTHONHASHSEED**

    If this variable is not set or set to ```random```, a random value is used to seed the hashes of *str*, *bytes* and *datetime* objects.

    *New in version 3.2.3.*

* **PYTHONIOENCODING**

    If this is set before running the interpreter, it overrides the encoding used for *stdin*, *stdout*, *stderr*, in the syntax *encodingname:errorhandler*. Both the *encodingname* and the *:errorhandler* parts are optional and have the same meaning as in ```str.encode()```.

* **PYTHONNOUSERSITE**

    If this is set, Python won’t add the user *site-packages directory* to ```sys.path```, refer to [PEP 370: Per user site-packages directory](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370).

* **PYTHONUSERBASE**

    Defines the [user base directory](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE), which is used to compute the path of the user *site-packages directory* and *Distutils installation paths* for ```python setup.py install --user```.

* **PYTHONEXECUTABLE**

    If this environment variable is set, ```sys.argv[0]``` will be set to its value instead of the value got through the C runtime. Only works on Mac OS X.

* **PYTHONWARNINGS**

    This is equivalent to the ```-W``` option. If set to a comma separated string, it is equivalent to specifying ```-W``` multiple times.

* **PYTHONFAULTHANDLER**

    If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, ```faulthandler.enable()``` is called at startup: install a handler for SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGABRT, SIGBUS and SIGILL signals to dump the Python traceback. This is equivalent to ```-X faulthandler``` option.

    *New in version 3.3.*

* **PYTHONTRACEMALLOC**

    If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, start tracing Python memory allocations using the *tracemalloc* module. The value of the variable is the maximum number of frames stored in a traceback of a trace. For example, ```PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=1``` stores only the most recent frame. See the ```tracemalloc.start()``` for more information.

    *New in version 3.4.*

* **PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG**

    If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, enable the *debug mode* of the *asyncio* module.

    *New in version 3.4.*

* **PYTHONMALLOC**

    Set the Python memory allocators and/or install debug hooks.

    *New in version 3.6.*

* **PYTHONMALLOCSTATS**

    If set to a non-empty string, Python will print statistics of the *pymalloc memory allocator* every time a new pymalloc object arena is created, and on shutdown.

* **PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING**

    If set to a non-empty string, the default filesystem encoding and errors mode will revert to their pre-3.6 values of *mbcs* and *replace*, respectively. Otherwise, the new defaults *utf-8* and *surrogatepass* are used. This may also be enabled at runtime with ```sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()```.

    Availability: Windows

* **PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSIOENCODING**

    If set to a non-empty string, does not use the new console reader and writer. This means that Unicode characters will be encoded according to the active console code page, rather than using *utf-8*. This variable is ignored if the standard streams are redirected (to files or pipes) rather than referring to console buffers.

    Availability: Windows

    *New in version 3.6.*

* **PYTHONTHREADDEBUG**

    Setting this variable only has an effect in a debug build of Python, that is, if Python was configured with the ```--with-pydebug``` build option.

    If set, Python will print threading debug info.

* **PYTHONDUMPREFS**

    Setting this variable only has an effect in a debug build of Python, that is, if Python was configured with the ```--with-pydebug``` build option.

    If set, Python will dump objects and reference counts still alive after shutting down the interpreter.

# Python Language

Python documentation:

* [Python 2.x Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/)
* [Python 3.x Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

For C or C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist:

* [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html#extending-index) describes the high-level picture of how to write a Python extension module
* [Python/C API Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html#c-api-index) describes the interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in detail

And you can find the index of all functions, classes, terms on:

* [General Index of Python 2.x Symbols](https://docs.python.org/2/genindex.html)
* [General Index of Python 3.x Symbols](https://docs.python.org/3/genindex.html)

## Keywords

The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or *keywords* of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as written here. More information can be found at [Simple statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html) and [Compound statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html) in [Python 3.x Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html).

```
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
```

The **keyword** module allows a Python program to determine if a string is a keyword. Its source code is located in **Lib/keyword.py**:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~/cpython $ ll Lib/keyword.py
-rwxrwxr-x 1 chenwx chenwx 2.2K Mar 26 18:40 Lib/keyword.py

[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import keyword

>>> keyword.kwlist

>>> print(*keyword.kwlist)
False None True and as assert break class continue def del elif else except finally for from global if import in is lambda nonlocal not or pass raise return try while with yield

>>> keyword.iskeyword("for")
True
```

## Operators

The following tokens are operators:

```
+       -       *       **      /       //      %      @
<<      >>      &       |       ^       ~
<       >       <=      >=      ==      !=
```

![Python_Operator_Precedence](/assets/Python_Operators.png)

Python operator precedence:

![Python_Operator_Precedence](/assets/Python_Operator_Precedence.png)

The **operator** module exports a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python. Its source code is located in **Lib/operator.py**:

```

>>> import operator

>>> dir(operator)

```

## Delimiters

The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar:

```
(       )       [       ]       {       }
,       :       .       ;       @       =       ->
+=      -=      *=      /=      //=     %=      @=
&=      |=      ^=      >>=     <<=     **=
```

The period (```.```) can also occur in floating-point and imaginary literals. A sequence of three periods (```...```) has a special meaning as an ellipsis literal. The second half of the list, the augmented assignment operators, serve lexically as delimiters, but also perform an operation.

The following printing ASCII characters have special meaning as part of other tokens or are otherwise significant to the lexical analyzer:

```
'       "       #       \
```

The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python. Their occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:

```
$       ?       `
```

## Comments

**One Line Comments**

Typically, you just use the hash character (```#```) to comment out everything that follows it on that line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character (```#```) within a string literal is just a hash character.

```
# this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
```

**Multiple Line Comments**

Multiple line comments simply use 3 single quotes (```'''```) before and after the part you want commented:

```
'''
print("We are in a comment")
print("We are still in a comment")
'''
print("We are out of the comment")
```

## Encoding Declaration

If a comment in the **first or second line of the Python script** matches the regular expression (see [PEP 263: Defining Python Source Code Encodings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/)):

```
^[ \t\v]*#.*?coding[:=][ \t]*([-_.a-zA-Z0-9]+)
```

or, the regular expression (see [encoding declarations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encoding-declarations)):

```
coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+)
```

this comment is processed as an **encoding declaration**. The first group of this expression names the encoding of the source code file. If the encoding is unknown to Python, an error is raised during compilation. More supported encoding can be found at:

* Python 2.x [Standard Encodings](https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings) and [Python Specific Encodings](https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#python-specific-encodings)
* Python 3.x [Standard Encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings) and [Python Specific Encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#python-specific-encodings)

There must not be any Python statement on the line that contains the encoding declaration, that's the encoding declaration must appear on a line of its own. If the first line matches the second line is ignored; if it is the second line, the first line must also be a comment-only line, for instance:

```
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-
```

or,

```
#!/usr/bin/python
# vim: set fileencoding=<encoding name> :
```

The recommended forms of an encoding expression are

```
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-
```

which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and

```
# vim: set fileencoding=<encoding name> :
```

which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar’s VIM.

If no encoding declaration is found, the default encoding is **UTF-8**, refer to [PEP 3120: Using UTF-8 as the default source encoding](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/). If an encoding is declared, the encoding name must be recognized by Python. The encoding is used for all lexical analysis, including string literals, comments and identifiers. Refer to [PEP 263: Defining Python Source Code Encodings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/).

## Indentation

Indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. Each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.

Leading whitespace (**spaces** and **tabs**) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.

**Tabs** are replaced (from left to right) by **one to eight spaces** such that the total number of characters up to and including the replacement is a multiple of eight (this is intended to be the same rule as used by Unix). The total number of **spaces** preceding the first non-blank character then determines the line’s indentation. Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation.

Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in spaces; a **TabError** is raised in that case.

**Tab or spaces?**

According to [PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), **spaces are the preferred indentation method**. **Tabs** should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.

**Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation**. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively. When invoking the Python 2 command line interpreter with the ```-t``` option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes tabs and spaces. When using ```-tt``` these warnings become errors. These options are highly recommended!

## Data Structures

### Lists

Run the following command to check help information of list:

```
>>> help(list)
```

Create a list:

```
>>> squares = []
>>> for x in range(10):
...     squares.append(x**2)
...
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

>>> type(squares)
<class 'list'>
```

or,

```
>>> squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

or,

```
>>> squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

Lists are **mutable**:

```
>>> squares[0] = 10
>>> squares[1] = 11
>>> squares
[10, 11, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the ```del``` statement. This differs from the ```pop()``` method which returns a value. The ```del``` statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list.

```
>>> squares.pop()
81
>>> squares
[10, 11, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]

>>> squares.pop()
64
>>> squares
[10, 11, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]

>>> del squares[0]
>>> squares
[11, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]

>>> del squares[2:4]
>>> squares
[11, 4, 25, 36, 49]

>>> del squares[:]
>>> squares
[]
```

The ```del``` statement can also be used to delete entire variables:

```
>>> squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
>>> squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

>>> del squares
>>> squares
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'squares' is not defined
```

Referencing the name ```squares``` hereafter is an error, at least until another value is assigned to it.

### Tuples

Run the following command to check help information of tuple:

```
>>> help(tuple)
```

A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas:

```
>>> t = (12345, 54321, 'hello!')    # or, t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
>>> t
(12345, 54321, 'hello!')
>>> t[0]
12345

>>> type(t)
<class 'tuple'>
```


Tuples may be nested:

```
>>> u = (t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))        # or, u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>>> u
((12345, 54321, 'hello!'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

Tuples are **immutable**. It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, *however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects*, such as lists:

```
>>> v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])      # or, v = [1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]
>>> v
([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])

>>> v[0] = [11, 22, 33]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

>>> v[0][1] = 22
>>> v
([1, 22, 3], [3, 2, 1])
```

A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective.

```
>>> empty = ()
>>> len(empty)
0
>>> empty
()

>>> singleton = ('hello',)          # or, singleton = 'hello',  <-- note trailing comma
>>> len(singleton)
1
>>> singleton
('hello',)
```

This is **sequence unpacking** and works for any sequence on the right-hand side. **Sequence unpacking** requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that **multiple assignment** is really just a combination of **tuple packing** and **sequence unpacking**.

```
>>> t = (12345, 54321, 'hello!')    # or, t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
>>> t
(12345, 54321, 'hello!')

>>> x, y, z = t
>>> x
12345
>>> y
54321
>>> z
'hello!'
```

### Sets

Run the following command to check help information of set:

```
>>> help(set)
```

A set is an **unordered** collection with **no duplicate elements**. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

Curly braces (```{}```) or the ```set()``` function can be used to create sets. Note that in order to create an empty set you have to use ```set()```, not ```{}```; the latter creates an empty dictionary.

```
>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
>>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed
{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}
>>> basket
{'orange', 'pear', 'banana', 'apple'}

>>> type(basket)
<class 'set'>

>>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing
True
>>> 'crabgrass' in basket
False
```

Demonstrate ```set()``` operations on unique letters from two words:

```
>>> a = set('abracadabra')
>>> a                                  # unique letters in a
{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}

>>> b = set('alacazam')
>>> b                                  # unique letters in b
{'z', 'a', 'm', 'c', 'l'}

>>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
{'r', 'd', 'b'}
>>> a | b                              # letters in either a or b
{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
>>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
{'a', 'c'}
>>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both
{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
```

### Dictionaries

Run the following command to check help information of dict:

```
>>> help(dict)
```

Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any **immutable** type; strings and numbers can always be *keys*.

It is best to think of a dictionary as an **unordered** set of **key:value** pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: ```{}```. Placing a comma-separated list of **key:value** pairs within the braces adds initial **key:value** pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten.

```
>>> tel = {}
>>> tel
{}

>>> type(tel)
<class 'dict'>

>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4140}
>>> tel
{'sape': 4140, 'jack': 4098}

>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139, 'sape': 4141}
>>> tel
{'sape': 4141, 'jack': 4098}
```

The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a **key:value** pair with ```del``` statement. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key. To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the ```in``` keyword.

```
>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
>>> tel
{'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098}

>>> tel['guido'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}

>>> tel['jack']
4098

>>> del tel['sape']
{'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}

>>> tel['irv'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127, 'jack': 4098}

>>> list(tel.keys())
['irv', 'guido', 'jack']

>>> sorted(tel.keys())
['guido', 'irv', 'jack']

>>> 'guido' in tel
True

>>> 'jack' not in tel
False
```

The ```dict()``` constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of **key:value** pairs:

```
>>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])
{'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}
```

In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value expressions:

```
>>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}
{2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}
```

When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:

```
>>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)
{'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}
```

When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the ```items()``` method.

```
>>> knights = {'gallahad': 'the pure', 'robin': 'the brave'}
>>> for k, v in knights.items():
...     print(k, v)
...
gallahad the pure
robin the brave
```

## Statements

### Multiple Assignment

The expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.

```
# Fibonacci series: the sum of two elements defines the next
a, b = 0, 1
while (b < 10)
    print(b)
    a, b = b, a+b
```

### assert

The ```assert``` statements are a convenient way to insert debugging assertions into a program:

```
assert <expression> [, <expression> ]
```

The simple form, ```assert <expression>```, is equivalent to

```
if __debug__:
    if not <expression>: raise AssertionError
```

The extended form, ```assert <expression1>, <expression2>```, is equivalent to

```
if __debug__:
    if not <expression1>: raise AssertionError(<expression2>)
```

These equivalences assume that ```__debug__``` and ```AssertionError``` refer to the built-in variables with those names. In the current implementation, the built-in variable ```__debug__``` is **True** under normal circumstances, **False** when optimization is requested (command line option ```-O```). The current code generator emits no code for an assert statement when optimization is requested at compile time. Note that it is unnecessary to include the source code for the *expression* that failed in the error message; it will be displayed as part of the stack trace.

Assignments to ```__debug__``` are illegal. The value for the built-in variable is determined when the interpreter starts.

### pass

The ```pass``` statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.

```
>>> def initlog(*args):
...     pass   # Remember to implement this!
...
```

### del

```
del <target_list>
```

Deletion is recursively defined very similar to the way assignment is defined. Rather than spelling it out in full details, here are some hints.

Deletion of a target list recursively deletes each target, from left to right.

Deletion of a name removes the binding of that name from the local or global namespace, depending on whether the name occurs in a global statement in the same code block. If the name is unbound, a **NameError** exception will be raised.

Deletion of attribute references, subscriptions and slicings is passed to the primary object involved; deletion of a slicing is in general equivalent to assignment of an empty slice of the right type (but even this is determined by the sliced object).

***Changed in version 3.2***: Previously it was illegal to delete a name from the local namespace if it occurs as a free variable in a nested block.

### return

```
return <expression_list>
```

The ```return``` statement may only occur syntactically nested in a [function definition](#functions), not within a nested [class definition](#classes).

If an *expression_list* is present, it is evaluated, else **None** is substituted.

The ```return``` statement leaves the current function call with the *expression_list* or **None** as return value.

When ```return``` passes control out of a ```try``` statement with a ```finally``` clause, that ```finally``` clause is executed before really leaving the function.

In a generator function, the ```return``` statement indicates that the generator is done and will cause **StopIteration** to be raised. The returned value (if any) is used as an argument to construct **StopIteration** and becomes the **StopIteration.value** attribute.

In an asynchronous generator function, an empty return statement indicates that the asynchronous generator is done and will cause **StopAsyncIteration×× to be raised. A non-empty return statement is a syntax error in an asynchronous generator function.

### yield

A ```yield``` statement is semantically equivalent to a **yield expression**. The ```yield``` statement can be used to omit the parentheses that would otherwise be required in the equivalent **yield expression** statement. For example, the yield statements

```
yield <expr>
yield from <expr>
```

are equivalent to the yield expression statements

```
(yield <expr>)
(yield from <expr>)
```

The ```yield``` expressions and statements are only used when defining a generator function, and are only used in the body of the generator function. Using yield in a function definition is sufficient to cause that definition to create a generator function instead of a normal function. Refer to [yield expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr).

### raise

```
raise [<expression] [from <expression>]]
```

If no expressions are present, the ```raise``` statement re-raises the last exception that was active in the current scope. If no exception is active in the current scope, a **RuntimeError** exception is raised indicating that this is an error.

Otherwise, the ```raise``` statement evaluates the first *expression* as the exception object. It must be either a subclass or an instance of **BaseException**. If it is a class, the exception instance will be obtained when needed by instantiating the class with no arguments.

The *type* of the exception is the exception instance's class, the value is the instance itself.

***Changed in version 3.3***: ```None``` is now permitted as *Y* in ```raise X from Y```.

### break

The ```break``` statement may only occur syntactically nested in a ```for``` or ```while``` loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within that loop.

It terminates the **nearest enclosing loop**, skipping the optional ```else``` clause if the loop has one.

* Loop statements (```for``` and ```while```) may have an ```else``` clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with ```for```) or when the condition becomes false (with ```while```), but not when the loop is terminated by a ```break``` statement.

If a ```for``` loop is terminated by ```break```, the loop control target keeps its current value.

When ```break``` passes control out of a ```try``` statement with a ```finally``` clause, that ```finally``` clause is executed before really leaving the loop.

```
>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
...             break
...     else:
...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
...
2 is a prime number
3 is a prime number
4 equals 2 * 2
5 is a prime number
6 equals 2 * 3
7 is a prime number
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3
```

### continue

The ```continue``` statment may only occur syntactically nested in a ```for``` or ```while``` loop, but not nested in a function or class definition or ```finally``` clause within that loop. It continues with the next cycle of the **nearest enclosing loop**.

When ```continue``` statement passes control out of a ```try``` statement with a ```finally``` clause, that ```finally``` clause is executed before really starting the next loop cycle.

```
>>> for num in range(2, 10):
...     if num % 2 == 0:
...         print("Found an even number", num)
...         continue
...     print("Found a number", num)
Found an even number 2
Found a number 3
Found an even number 4
Found a number 5
Found an even number 6
Found a number 7
Found an even number 8
Found a number 9
```

### import

According to [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html), Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it. The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only way. Functions such as ```importlib.import_module()``` and built-in ```__import__()``` can also be used to invoke the import machinery.

The *import* statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search operation of the *import* statement is defined as a call to the ```__import__()``` function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of __import__() is used to perform the name binding operation of the *import* statement.

```
import <module1> [as <name1>] [, <moduleN> [as <nameN>]]

from <relative_module> import  <identifier1> [as <name1>] [, <identifierN> [as <nameN>]]
from <relative_module> import (<identifier1> [as <name1>] [, <identifierN> [as <nameN>]])

from <module> import *
```

### global

```
global <identifier1> [, <identifier2> [, <identifierN>]]
```

The ```global``` statement is a declaration which holds for the entire current code block. It means that the listed *identifiers* are to be interpreted as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable without ```global```, although free variables may refer to globals without being declared ```global```.

Names listed in a ```global``` statement must not be used in the same code block textually preceding that ```global``` statement.

Names listed in a ```global``` statement must not be defined as formal parameters or in a ```for``` loop control target, class definition, function definition, ```import``` statement, or variable annotation.

### nonlocal

```
nonlocal <identifier1> [, <identifier2> [, <identifierN>]]
```

The ```nonlocal``` statement causes the listed *identifiers* to refer to previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope excluding globals. This is important because the default behavior for binding is to search the local namespace first. The statement allows encapsulated code to rebind variables outside of the local scope besides the global (module) scope.

Names listed in a ```nonlocal``` statement, unlike those listed in a ```global``` statement, must refer to pre-existing bindings in an enclosing scope (the scope in which a new binding should be created cannot be determined unambiguously).

Names listed in a ```nonlocal``` statement must not collide with pre-existing bindings in the local scope.

### if..elif..else

The ```if``` statement is used for conditional execution. There can be zero or more ```elif``` parts, and the ```else``` part is optional:

```
if <expression1>:
    <suite1>
elif <expression2>:
    <suite2>
elif <expressionM>:
    <suiteM>
else:
    <suiteN>
```

It selects exactly one of the *suites* by evaluating the *expressions* one by one until one is found to be true; then that *suite* is executed (and no other part of the ```if``` statement is executed or evaluated). If all *expressions* are false, the *suite* of the ```else``` clause, if present, is executed. For instance:

```
>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
>>> if x < 0:
...     x = 0
...     print('Negative changed to zero')
... elif x == 0:
...     print('Zero')
... elif x == 1:
...     print('Single')
... else:
...     print('More')
...
More
```

### for

The ```for``` statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:

```
for <target_list> in <expression_list>:
    <suite>
else:
    <suite>
```

The *expression_list* is evaluated once; it should yield an iterable object. An iterator is created for the result of the *expression_list*. The *suite* is then executed once for each item provided by the iterator, in the order returned by the iterator. Each item in turn is assigned to the *target list* using the standard rules for assignments, and then the *suite* is executed. When the items are exhausted (which is immediately when the sequence is empty or an iterator raises a **StopIteration** exception), the *suite* in the ```else``` clause, if present, is executed, and the loop terminates.

A ```break``` statement executed in the first *suite* terminates the loop **without** executing the ```else``` clause's *suite*. A ```continue``` statement executed in the first *suite* skips the rest of the *suite* and continues with the next item, or with the ```else``` clause if there is no next item.

Names in the *target_list* are not deleted when the loop is finished, but if the sequence is empty, they will not have been assigned to at all by the loop. Hint: the built-in function ```range()``` returns an iterator of integers suitable to emulate the effect of Pascal's ```for i := a to b do```; e.g., ```list(range(3))``` returns the list ```[0, 1, 2]```.

```
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4

>>> words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
>>> for w in words:
...     print(w, len(w))
...
('cat', 3)
('window', 6)
('defenestrate', 12)
```

If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended that you first make a copy. Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The **slice notation** makes this especially convenient:

```
>>> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.
...     if len(w) > 6:
...         words.insert(0, w)
...
>>> words
['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
```

### while

In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false.

The ```while``` statement is used for repeated execution as long as an *expression* is true:

```
while <expression>:
    <suite>
else:
    <suite>
```

This repeatedly tests the *expression* and, if it is true, executes the first *suite*; if the *expression* is false (which may be the first time it is tested) the *suite* of the ```else``` clause, if present, is executed and the loop terminates.

A ```break``` statement executed in the first *suite* terminates the loop **without** executing the ```else``` clause's *suite*. A ```continue``` statement executed in the first *suite* skips the rest of the *suite* and goes back to testing the *expression*.

```
>>> # Fibonacci series: the sum of two elements defines the next
... a, b = 0, 1
>>> while b < 10:
...     print(b)
...     a, b = b, a+b
... else:
...     print(100)
...
1
1
2
3
5
8
100
```

## Functions

The keyword ```def``` introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.

```
>>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         print(a, end=' ')
...         a, b = b, a+b
...     print()
...
>>> # Now call the function we just defined:
... fib(2000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597
```

A function definition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function name has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-defined function. This value can be assigned to another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:

```
>>> fib
<function fib at 10042ed0>
>>> f = fib
>>> f(100)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
```

The ```return``` statement returns with a value from a function. ```return``` without an expression argument returns ```None```. Falling off the end of a function also returns ```None```.

```
>>> def fib2(n):  # return Fibonacci series up to n
...     """Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n."""
...     result = []
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         result.append(a)    # see below
...         a, b = b, a+b
...     return result
...
>>> f100 = fib2(100)    # call it
>>> f100                # write the result
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```

### docstring

The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s **documentation string**, or **docstring**.

The first line should always be a short, concise summary of the object’s purpose. For brevity, it should not explicitly state the object’s name or type, since these are available by other means (except if the name happens to be a verb describing a function’s operation). This line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.

If there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description. The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing the object’s calling conventions, its side effects, etc.

The Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals in Python, so tools that process documentation have to strip indentation if desired. This is done using the following convention. The first non-blank line *after* the first line of the string determines the amount of indentation for the entire documentation string. (We can’t use the first line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes so its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace *equivalent* to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).

```
>>> def my_function():
...     """Do nothing, but document it.
...
...     No, really, it doesn't do anything.
...     """
...     pass
...
>>> print(my_function.__doc__)
Do nothing, but document it.

    No, really, it doesn't do anything.
```

### Default Argument Values

The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the *defining scope*:

```
>>> i = 5
>>> def f(arg = i):
...     print(arg)
...
>>> i = 6
>>> f()
5
```

The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. The following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:

```
>>> def f(a, L = []):
...     L.append(a)
...     return L
...
>>> print(f(1))
[1]
>>> print(f(2))
[1, 2]
>>> print(f(3))
[1, 2, 3]
```

If you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:

```
>>> def f(a, L=None):
...     if L is None:
...         L = []
...     L.append(a)
...     return L
...
>>> print(f(1))
[1]
>>> print(f(2))
[2]
>>> print(f(3))
[3]
```

### Keyword Arguments

Functions can also be called using *keyword arguments* of the form ```kwarg=value```. The function:

```
>>> def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom', type='Norwegian Blue'):
...     print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
...     print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.")
...     print("-- Lovely plumage, the", type)
...     print("-- It's", state, "!")
...
```

can be called in any of the following ways:

```
parrot(1000)                                          # 1 positional argument
parrot(voltage=1000)                                  # 1 keyword argument
parrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)             # 2 keyword arguments
parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments
parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword
```

Note:

* In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments.
* All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function and their order is not important.
* No argument may receive a value more than once.

When a final formal parameter of the form ```**name``` is present, it receives a *dictionary* containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form ```*name``` which receives a *tuple* containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. ```*name``` must occur before ```**name```.

### Arbitrary Argument Lists

A function can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments. These arguments will be wrapped up in a *tuple*. Before the variable number of arguments, zero or more normal arguments may occur.

```
def write_multiple_items(file, separator, *args):
    file.write(separator.join(args))
```

Normally, these variadic arguments will be **last** in the list of formal parameters, because they scoop up all remaining input arguments that are passed to the function. Any formal parameters which occur after the ```*args``` parameter are *keyword-only* arguments, meaning that they can only be used as keywords rather than positional arguments.

```
>>> def concat(*args, sep="/"):
...     return sep.join(args)
...
>>> concat("earth", "mars", "venus")            # sep = "/" in this case
'earth/mars/venus'
>>> concat("earth", "mars", "venus", sep=".")   # sep = "." in this case
'earth.mars.venus'
```

### Unpacking Argument Lists

The reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a **list** or **tuple** but need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional arguments. If they are not available separately, write the function call with the ```*```-operator to unpack the arguments out of a **list** or **tuple**:

```
>>> list(range(3, 6))        # normal call with separate arguments
[3, 4, 5]
>>> args = [3, 6]
>>> list(range(*args))       # call with arguments unpacked from a list
[3, 4, 5]
```

In the same fashion, **dictionaries** can deliver keyword arguments with the ```**```-operator:

```
>>> def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom'):
...     print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
...     print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.", end=' ')
...     print("E's", state, "!")
...
>>> d = {"voltage": "four million", "state": "bleedin' demised", "action": "VOOM"}
>>> parrot(**d)
-- This parrot wouldn't VOOM if you put four million volts through it. E's bleedin' demised !
```

### Lambda Expressions

Small anonymous functions can be created with the ```lambda``` keyword. This function returns the sum of its two arguments: ```lambda a, b: a+b```. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition. Like nested function definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope:

```
>>> def make_incrementor(n):
...     return lambda x: x + n
...
>>> f = make_incrementor(42)
>>> f(0)
42
>>> f(1)
43
```

The above example uses a lambda expression to return a function. Another use is to pass a small function as an argument:

```
>>> pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]
>>> pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])
>>> pairs
[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]
```

### Function Annotations

Function annotations are completely optional metadata information about the types used by user-defined functions, see [PEP 484: Type Hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) for more information.

Annotations are stored in the ```__annotations__``` attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no effect on any other part of the function.

Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation.

Return annotations are defined by a literal ```->```, followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of the ```def``` statement. The following example has a positional argument, a keyword argument, and the return value annotated:

```
>>> def f(ham: str, eggs: str = 'eggs') -> str:
...     print("Annotations:", f.__annotations__)
...     print("Arguments:", ham, eggs)
...     return ham + ' and ' + eggs
...
>>> f('spam')
Annotations: {'ham': <class 'str'>, 'return': <class 'str'>, 'eggs': <class 'str'>}
Arguments: spam eggs
'spam and eggs'
```

## Modules

If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead.

To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a *module*; definitions from a module can be *imported* into other modules or into the *main* module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix **.py** appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable **__name__**. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called *fibo.py* in the current directory with the following contents:

```
# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        print(b, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

def fib2(n):   # return Fibonacci series up to n
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        result.append(b)
        a, b = b, a+b
    return result
```

Now enter the Python interpreter and import this module and access the functions with the following command:

```
>>> import fibo

>>> fibo.fib(1000)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
>>> fibo.fib2(100)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

>>> fibo.__name__
'fibo'

>>> fib = fibo.fib
>>> fib(500)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
```

A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions. These statements are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement.

Each module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, ```modname.itemname```.

Modules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to place all ```import``` statements at the beginning of a module (or script, for that matter). The imported module names are placed in the importing module’s global symbol table.

There is a variant of the ```import``` statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing module’s symbol table. This does not introduce the module name from which the imports are taken in the local symbol table (so in the example, *fibo* is not defined):

```
>>> from fibo import fib, fib2
>>> fib(500)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
```

There is even a variant to import all names that a module defines. This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore ```_```:

```
>>> from fibo import *
>>> fib(500)
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
```

### Executing modules as scripts

When you run a Python module with following command, the code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the ```__name__``` set to ```__main__```.

```
python fibo.py <arguments>
```

or, by adding this code at the end of your module:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))
```

you can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the module is executed as the main file:

```
$ python fibo.py 50
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

### Module Search Path

When a module named *spam* is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named *spam.py* in a list of directories given by the variable ```sys.path```, which is initialized from these locations:

* The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).
* PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).
* The installation-dependent default.

Note: On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words the directory containing the symlink is **not** added to the module search path.

After initialization, Python programs can modify ```sys.path```. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended.

### Compiled Python Files

To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module in the ```__pycache__``` directory under the name *module.version.pyc*, where the *version* encodes the format of the compiled file; it generally contains the Python version number, such as ```__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc```. This naming convention allows compiled modules from different releases and different versions of Python to coexist.

Python checks the modification date of the source against the compiled version to see if it’s out of date and needs to be recompiled.

Python does not check the cache in two circumstances:

1. It always recompiles and does not store the result for the module that’s loaded directly from the command line.
2. It does not check the cache if there is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must be in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.

## Packages

Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using **dotted module names**. For example, the module name **A.B** designates a submodule named **B** in a package named **A**.

```
sound/                          # Top-level package
      __init__.py               # Initialize the sound package
      formats/                  # Subpackage for file format conversions
              __init__.py
              wavread.py
              wavwrite.py
              aiffread.py
              aiffwrite.py
              auread.py
              auwrite.py
              ...
      effects/                  # Subpackage for sound effects
              __init__.py
              echo.py
              surround.py
              reverse.py
              ...
      filters/                  # Subpackage for filters
              __init__.py
              equalizer.py
              vocoder.py
              karaoke.py
              ...
```

When importing the package, Python searches through the directories on **sys.path** looking for the package subdirectory.

The **__init__.py** files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as *string*, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, **__init__.py** can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the ```__all__``` variable.

Users of the package can import individual modules from the package:

```
import sound.effects.echo
```

This loads the submodule *sound.effects.echo*. It must be referenced with its full name.

```
sound.effects.echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)
```

An alternative way of importing the submodule is:

```
from sound.effects import echo
```

This also loads the submodule *echo*, and makes it available without its package prefix, so it can be used as follows:

```
echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)
```

Yet another variation is to import the desired function or variable directly:

```
from sound.effects.echo import echofilter
```

Again, this loads the submodule *echo*, but this makes its function ```echofilter()``` directly available:

```
echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)
```

### \_\_init\_\_.py

The ```import``` statement uses the following convention:

If a package’s ```__init__.py``` code defines a list named ```__all__```, it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when ```from package import *``` is encountered. The following code would mean that from sound.effects import * would import the three named submodules of the sound package:

```
__all__ = ["echo", "surround", "reverse"]
```

If ```__all__``` is not defined, the statement ```from sound.effects import *``` does not import all submodules from the package *sound.effects* into the current namespace; it only ensures that the package *sound.effects* has been imported (possibly running any initialization code in ```__init__.py```) and then imports whatever names are defined in the package. This includes any names defined (and submodules explicitly loaded) by ```__init__.py```. It also includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded by previous ```import``` statements.

### dir() Function

The built-in function ```dir()``` is used to find out which names a module defines (including all types of names: variables, modules, functions, etc). It returns a sorted list of strings. Without arguments, ```dir()``` lists the names you have defined currently.

```
>>> dir()
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', '__package__']
>>>
>>> import sys
>>> dir(sys)
['__displayhook__', '__doc__', '__egginsert', '__excepthook__', '__name__', '__package__', '__plen', '__stderr__', '__stdin__', '__stdout__', '_clear_type_cache', '_current_frames', '_getframe', '_mercurial', 'api_version', 'argv', 'builtin_module_names', 'byteorder', 'call_tracing', 'callstats', 'copyright', 'displayhook', 'dont_write_bytecode', 'exc_clear', 'exc_info', 'exc_type', 'excepthook', 'exec_prefix', 'executable', 'exit', 'exitfunc', 'flags', 'float_info', 'float_repr_style', 'getcheckinterval', 'getdefaultencoding', 'getdlopenflags', 'getfilesystemencoding', 'getprofile', 'getrecursionlimit', 'getrefcount', 'getsizeof', 'gettrace', 'hexversion', 'long_info', 'maxint', 'maxsize', 'maxunicode', 'meta_path', 'modules', 'path', 'path_hooks', 'path_importer_cache', 'platform', 'prefix', 'ps1', 'ps2', 'py3kwarning', 'setcheckinterval', 'setdlopenflags', 'setprofile', 'setrecursionlimit', 'settrace', 'stderr', 'stdin', 'stdout', 'subversion', 'version', 'version_info', 'warnoptions']
>>>
>>> print(sys.version)
3.5.0 (default, Dec 21 2015, 22:50:16)
[GCC 4.8.2]
```

The ```dir()``` does not list the names of built-in functions and variables. If you want a list of those, they are defined in the standard module [builtins](https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html):

```
>>> import builtins
>>> dir(builtins)
['ArithmeticError', 'AssertionError', 'AttributeError', 'BaseException', 'BlockingIOError', 'BrokenPipeError', 'BufferError', 'BytesWarning', 'ChildProcessError', 'ConnectionAbortedError', 'ConnectionError', 'ConnectionRefusedError', 'ConnectionResetError', 'DeprecationWarning', 'EOFError', 'Ellipsis', 'EnvironmentError', 'Exception', 'False', 'FileExistsError', 'FileNotFoundError', 'FloatingPointError', 'FutureWarning', 'GeneratorExit', 'IOError', 'ImportError', 'ImportWarning', 'IndentationError', 'IndexError', 'InterruptedError', 'IsADirectoryError', 'KeyError', 'KeyboardInterrupt', 'LookupError', 'MemoryError', 'NameError', 'None', 'NotADirectoryError', 'NotImplemented', 'NotImplementedError', 'OSError', 'OverflowError', 'PendingDeprecationWarning', 'PermissionError', 'ProcessLookupError', 'RecursionError', 'ReferenceError', 'ResourceWarning', 'RuntimeError', 'RuntimeWarning', 'StopAsyncIteration', 'StopIteration', 'SyntaxError', 'SyntaxWarning', 'SystemError', 'SystemExit', 'TabError', 'TimeoutError', 'True', 'TypeError', 'UnboundLocalError', 'UnicodeDecodeError', 'UnicodeEncodeError', 'UnicodeError', 'UnicodeTranslateError', 'UnicodeWarning', 'UserWarning', 'ValueError', 'Warning', 'ZeroDivisionError', '__build_class__', '__debug__', '__doc__', '__import__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'abs', 'all', 'any', 'ascii', 'bin', 'bool', 'bytearray', 'bytes', 'callable', 'chr', 'classmethod', 'compile', 'complex', 'copyright', 'credits', 'delattr', 'dict', 'dir', 'divmod', 'enumerate', 'eval', 'exec', 'exit', 'filter', 'float', 'format', 'frozenset', 'getattr', 'globals', 'hasattr', 'hash', 'help', 'hex', 'id', 'input', 'int', 'isinstance', 'issubclass', 'iter', 'len', 'license', 'list', 'locals', 'map', 'max', 'memoryview', 'min', 'next', 'object', 'oct', 'open', 'ord', 'pow', 'print', 'property', 'quit', 'range', 'repr', 'reversed', 'round', 'set', 'setattr', 'slice', 'sorted', 'staticmethod', 'str', 'sum', 'super', 'tuple', 'type', 'vars', 'zip']
```

## Input and Output

## Errors and Exceptions

There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: **syntax errors** and **exceptions**.

### Syntax Errors

Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:

```
>>> while True print('Hello world')
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    while True print('Hello world')
                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

### Exceptions

Errors detected during execution are called *exceptions* and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here:

```
>>> 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message: *ZeroDivisionError*. Standard exception names are built-in identifiers (not reserved keywords). [Built-in Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions) lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings.

#### Handling Exceptions

It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions:

```
>>> while True:
...     try:
...         x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
...         break
...     except ValueError:
...         print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")
...
Please enter a number: abc
Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...
Please enter a number: 100
```

The ```try``` statement works as follows:

* First, the ```try``` clause (the statement(s) between the ```try``` and ```except``` keywords) is executed.
* If no exception occurs, the ```except``` clause is skipped and execution of the ```try``` statement is finished.
* If an exception occurs during execution of the ```try``` clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its type matches the exception named after the ```except``` keyword, the ```except``` clause is executed, and then execution continues after the ```try``` statement.
* If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the ```except``` clause, it is passed on to outer ```try``` statements; if no handler is found, it is an *unhandled exception* and execution stops with a message as shown above.

A ```try``` statement may have more than one ```except``` clause, to specify handlers for different exceptions. At most one handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding ```try``` clause, not in other handlers of the same ```try``` statement. An ```except``` clause may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple:

```
... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):
...     pass
```

The last except clause may omit the exception name(s), to serve as a wildcard. Use this with extreme caution, since it is easy to mask a real programming error in this way! It can also be used to print an error message and then re-raise the exception (allowing a caller to handle the exception as well):

```
import sys

try:
    f = open('myfile.txt')
    s = f.readline()
    i = int(s.strip())
except OSError as err:    # the except clause may specify a variable after the exception name
    print("OS error: {0}".format(err))
except ValueError:
    print("Could not convert data to an integer.")
except:
    print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
    raise
```

The ```try...except``` statement has an optional ```else``` clause, which, when present, must follow all ```except``` clauses. It is useful for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception:

```
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    try:
        f = open(arg, 'r')
    except OSError:
        print('cannot open', arg)
    else:
        print(arg, 'has', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
        f.close()
```

Exception handlers don’t just handle exceptions if they occur immediately in the try clause, but also if they occur inside functions that are called (even indirectly) in the try clause:

```
def this_fails():
    x = 1/0

try:
    this_fails()
except ZeroDivisionError as err:
    print('Handling run-time error:', err)
```

The ```try``` statement has another optional clause which is intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances:

```
>>> try:
...     raise KeyboardInterrupt
... finally:
...     print('Goodbye, world!')
...
Goodbye, world!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
KeyboardInterrupt
```

A ```finally``` clause is always executed before leaving the ```try``` statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. When an exception has occurred in the ```try``` clause and has not been handled by an ```except``` clause (or it has occurred in an ```except``` or ```else``` clause), it is re-raised after the ```finally``` clause has been executed. The ```finally``` clause is also executed *on the way out* when any other clause of the ```try``` statement is left via a ```break```, ```continue``` or ```return``` statement.

```
>>> def divide(x, y):
...     try:
...         result = x / y
...     except ZeroDivisionError:
...         print("division by zero!")
...     else:
...         print("result is", result)
...     finally:
...         print("executing finally clause")
...
>>> divide(2, 1)
result is 2.0
executing finally clause
>>>
>>> divide(2, 0)
division by zero!
executing finally clause
>>>
>>> divide("2", "1")
executing finally clause
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in divide
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'
```

In real world applications, the ```finally``` clause is useful for releasing external resources (such as files or network connections), regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful.

#### Raising Exceptions

The ```raise``` statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur:

```
try:
    raise NameError('HiThere')
except NameError:
    print('An exception flew by!')
    raise
```

#### User-defined Exceptions

Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class. Exceptions should typically be derived from the ```Exception``` class, either directly or indirectly.

```
>>> help(Exception)

Help on class Exception in module builtins:

```

Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do, but are usually kept simple, often only offering a number of attributes that allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for the exception. When creating a module that can raise several distinct errors, a common practice is to create a base class for exceptions defined by that module, and subclass that to create specific exception classes for different error conditions.

Most exceptions are defined with names that end in **Error**, similar to the naming of the standard exceptions.

Many standard modules define their own exceptions to report errors that may occur in functions they define.

## Classes

Compared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in **C++** and **Modula-3**. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.

### Scopes and Namespaces

A **namespace** is a mapping from names to objects. Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes:

* The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted.
* The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits.
* The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of a module called ```__main__```, so they have their own global namespace.
* The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function.

The built-in names actually also live in a module named **builtins**:

```
>>> import builtins
>>> dir(builtins)

A **scope** is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:

* the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names
* the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names
* the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names
* the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names

The ```global``` statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the ```nonlocal``` statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there.

### Class Definition Syntax

```
class ClassName:
    <statement-1>
    ...
    <statement-N>
```

Class definitions, like function definitions (```def``` statements) must be executed before they have any effect. You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an ```if``` statement, or inside a function.

In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful.

When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the *local scope*.

When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created.

```
>>> class MyClass:
...     '''A simple example class'''
...     def __init__(self, var):
...         self.i = var
...     def f(self):
...         return "Hello world"
...     i = 123
...
>>>
>>> help(MyClass)
Help on class MyClass in module __main__:

class MyClass(builtins.object)
 |  A simple example class
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, var)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  f(self)
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors defined here:
 |  
 |  __dict__
 |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
 |  
 |  __weakref__
 |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data and other attributes defined here:
 |  
 |  i = 123
```

The special thing about methods is that the instance object is passed as the first argument of the function, that's ```self```. In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the first argument.

### Class Objects

Class objects support two kinds of operations: **attribute references** and **instantiation**.

* **Attribute references** use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: ```obj.name```. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created.
* **Class instantiation** uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class: ```x = MyClass()```. When a class defines an ```__init__()``` method, class instantiation automatically invokes ```__init__()``` for the newly-created class instance.

### Class and Instance Variables

**Instance variables** are for data unique to each instance and **class variables** are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class:

```
>>> class Dog:
...     kind = 'canine'         # class variable shared by all instances
...     def __init__(self, name):
...         self.name = name    # instance variable unique to each instance
...
>>> d = Dog('Fido')
>>> e = Dog('Buddy')
>>> d.kind                      # shared by all dogs
'canine'
>>> e.kind                      # shared by all dogs
'canine'
>>> d.name                      # unique to d
'Fido'
>>> e.name                      # unique to e
'Buddy'
```

### Random Remarks

Data attributes override method attributes with the same name; to avoid accidental name conflicts, which may cause hard-to-find bugs in large programs, it is wise to use some kind of convention that minimizes the chance of conflicts. Possible conventions include capitalizing method names, prefixing data attribute names with a small unique string (perhaps just an underscore), or using verbs for methods and nouns for data attributes.

### Inheritance

The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this:

```
class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    <statement-1>
    ...
    <statement-N>
```

Derived classes may override methods of their base classes. For C++ programmers: all methods in Python are effectively *virtual*.

An overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call ```BaseClassName.methodName(self, arguments)```.

Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:

* Use ```isinstance()``` to check an instance’s type: ```isinstance(obj, int)``` will be True only if ```obj.__class__``` is ```int``` or some class derived from ```int```.
* Use ```issubclass()``` to check class inheritance: ```issubclass(bool, int)``` is True since ```bool``` is a subclass of ```int```. However, ```issubclass(float, int)``` is False since ```float``` is not a subclass of ```int```.

Python supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this:

```
class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):
    <statement-1>
    ...
    <statement-N>
```

### Private Variables

**Private instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don't exist in Python.** However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. ```_spam```) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.

Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called **name mangling**. Any identifier of the form ```__spam``` (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with ```_classname__spam```, where *classname* is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class.

**Name mangling** is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls.

```
class Mapping:
    def __init__(self, iterable):
        self.items_list = []
        self.__update(iterable)

    def update(self, iterable):
        for item in iterable:
            self.items_list.append(item)

    __update = update   # private copy of original update() method

class MappingSubclass(Mapping):
    def update(self, keys, values):
        # provides new signature for update()
        # but does not break __init__()
        for item in zip(keys, values):
            self.items_list.append(item)
```

### Iterators

The most container objects can be looped over using a for statement:

```
for element in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(element)
for element in (1, 2, 3):
    print(element)
for key in {'one':1, 'two':2}:
    print(key)
for char in "123":
    print(char)
for line in open("myfile.txt"):
    print(line, end='')
```

The use of iterators pervades and unifies Python. Behind the scenes, the for statement calls ```iter()``` on the container object. The function returns an iterator object that defines the method ```__next__()``` which accesses elements in the container one at a time. When there are no more elements, ```__next__()``` raises a ```StopIteration``` exception which tells the for loop to terminate. You can call the ```__next__()``` method using the ```next()``` built-in function; this example shows how it all works:

```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> it = iter(s)
>>> it
<iterator object at 0x00A1DB50>
>>> next(it)
'a'
>>> next(it)
'b'
>>> next(it)
'c'
>>> next(it)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
    next(it)
StopIteration
```

Having seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to add iterator behavior to your classes. Define an ```__iter__()``` method which returns an object with a ```__next__()``` method. If the class defines ```__next__()```, then ```__iter__()``` can just return ```self```:

```
class Reverse:
    """Iterator for looping over a sequence backwards."""
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = len(data)

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index == 0:
            raise StopIteration
        self.index = self.index - 1
        return self.data[self.index]
```

```
>>> rev = Reverse('spam')
>>> iter(rev)
<__main__.Reverse object at 0x00A1DB50>
>>> for char in rev:
...     print(char)
...
m
a
p
s
```

Help information of method ```iter()```:

```
Help on built-in function iter in module builtins:

iter(...)
    iter(iterable) -> iterator
    iter(callable, sentinel) -> iterator

    Get an iterator from an object.  In the first form, the argument must
    supply its own iterator, or be a sequence.
    In the second form, the callable is called until it returns the sentinel.
```

Help information of method ```next()```:

```
Help on built-in function next in module builtins:

next(...)
    next(iterator[, default])

    Return the next item from the iterator. If default is given and the iterator
    is exhausted, it is returned instead of raising StopIteration.
```

### Generators

Generators are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. They are written like regular functions but use the ```yield``` statement whenever they want to return data. Each time ```next()``` is called on it, the generator resumes where it left off (it remembers all the data values and which statement was last executed). An example shows that generators can be trivially easy to create:

```
def reverse(data):
    for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):
        yield data[index]
```

```
>>> for char in reverse('golf'):
...     print(char)
...
f
l
o
g
```

# Python Libraries

## Python Standard Library

The Python Standard Library:

* [Python 2.x Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html)
* [Python 3.x Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)

The Python Module Index:

* [Python 2.x Module Index](https://docs.python.org/2/py-modindex.html)
* [Python 3.x Module Index](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)

In addition to the Python standard library, there is a growing collection of several thousand components (from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

The Python standard library contains:

* **Data types** that would normally be considered part of the core of a language, such as numbers and lists.
* **Built-in functions and exceptions** can be used by all Python code without the need of an ```import``` statement. Some of these are defined by the core language, but many are not essential for the core semantics.
* **Collection of modules**. Some modules are written in C and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and imported in source form. Some modules provide interfaces that are highly specific to Python, like printing a stack trace; some provide interfaces that are specific to particular operating systems, such as access to specific hardware; others provide interfaces that are specific to a particular application domain, like the World Wide Web. Some modules are available in all versions and ports of Python; others are only available when the underlying system supports or requires them; yet others are available only when a particular configuration option was chosen at the time when Python was compiled and installed.

    Return the absolute value of the argument.
```

### Built-in Constants

A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace. They are:

| Constants            | Description |
| :------------------- | :---------- |
| ```False```          | The false value of the ```bool``` type. Assignments to ```False``` are illegal and raise a ```SyntaxError```. |
| ```True```           | The true value of the ```bool``` type. Assignments to ```True``` are illegal and raise a ```SyntaxError```. |
| ```None```           | The sole value of the type ```NoneType```. ```None``` is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function. Assignments to ```None``` are illegal and raise a ```SyntaxError```. |
| ```NotImplemented``` | Special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e.g. ```__eq__()```, ```__lt__()```, ```__add__()```, ```__rsub__()```, etc.) to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type; may be returned by the in-place binary special methods (e.g. ```__imul__()```, ```__iand__()```, etc.) for the same purpose. Its truth value is true. |
| ```Ellipsis```       | The same as ```...```. Special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types. |
| ```__debug__```      | This constant is true if Python was not started with an ```-O``` option. Assignments to ```__debug__``` are illegal and raise a ```SyntaxError```. |

<br>

The [site](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html) module (which is imported automatically during startup, except if the ```-S``` command-line option is given) adds several constants to the built-in namespace. They are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should not be used in programs. Constants added by the [site](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html) module are:

| Constants            | Description |
| :------------------- | :---------- |
| ```quit(code=None)```<br>```exit(code=None)``` | Objects that when printed, print a message like **Use quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit**, and when called, raise ```SystemExit``` with the specified exit code. |
| ```copyright```<br>```license```<br>```credits``` | Objects that when printed, print a message like **Type license() to see the full license text**, and when called, display the corresponding text in a pager-like fashion (one screen at a time). |

## Other Python Libraries

Refer to the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) for packages used by the Python programming language.

Here is [20 Python libraries you can't live without](https://pythontips.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/):

| Libraries | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| [Requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/master/) | The most famous HTTP library written by *kenneth reitz*. It’s a must have for every python developer. |
| [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) | If you are involved in WebScraping then this is a must have library for you. After using this library you won’t use any other. |
| [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) | A GUI toolkit for Python. I have primarily used it in place of [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). You will really love it. |
| [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) | A friendly fork of PIL (Python Imaging Library). It is more user friendly than PIL and is a must have for anyone who works with images. |
| [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) | A database library. Many love it and many hate it. The choice is yours. |
| [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) | I know it’s slow but this XML and HTML parsing library is very useful for beginners. |
| [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) | The most important tool for any network application developer. It has a very beautiful API and is used by a lot of famous python developers. |
| [NumPy](numpy.scipy.org/) | How can we leave this very important library? It provides some advance math functionalities to python. |
| [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) | When we talk about NumPy then we have to talk about SciPy. It is a library of algorithms and mathematical tools for python and has caused many scientists to switch from ruby to python. Also see <a href="{{ site.base-url }}/2019/05/16/scientific-computing.html#scipy">Scientific Computing via SciPy</a>. |
| [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) | A numerical plotting library. It is very useful for any data scientist or any data analyzer. |
| [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) | Which developer does not like to play games and develop them? This library will help you achieve your goal of 2D game development. |
| [Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/) | A 3D animation and game creation engine. This is the engine in which the famous python port of [Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft) was made. |
| [pyQT](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/) | A GUI toolkit for python. It is my second choice after [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) for developing GUI’s for my python scripts. |
| [pyGtk](http://www.pygtk.org/) | Another python GUI library. It is the same library in which the famous Bittorrent client is created. |
| [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) | A packet sniffer and analyzer for Python made in Python. |
| [PyWin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/) | A Python library which provides some useful methods and classes for interacting with windows. |
| [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) | Natural Language Toolkit – I realize most people won’t be using this one, but it’s generic enough. It is a very useful library if you want to manipulate strings. But it’s capacity is beyond that. Do check it out. |
| [nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/) | A testing framework for Python. It is used by millions of Python developers. It is a must have if you do test driven development. |
| [SymPy](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/) | SymPy can do algebraic evaluation, differentiation, expansion, complex numbers, etc. It is contained in a pure Python distribution. |
| [IPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) | I just can’t stress enough how useful this tool is. It is a Python prompt on steroids. It has completion, history, shell capabilities, and a lot more. Make sure that you take a look at it. |

## PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code

For Python, [PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:

* Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs. 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.

* Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters. This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.

* Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.

* When possible, put comments on a line of their own.

* Use docstrings.

* Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: ```a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)```.

* Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use *CamelCase* for classes and *lower_case_with_underscores* for functions and methods. Always use ```self``` as the name for the first method argument.

* Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case. Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.

### autopep8

The tool ```autopep8``` is used to format the Python code to follow rules defined in [PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008):

```
$ pip install --upgrade autopep8

$ autopep8 --in-place --aggressive <filename>
```
