This article introduces the **ASIC** (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit).

# Overview

An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (**ASIC**) is an integrated circuit (IC) **customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use**. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency Bitcoin miner is an ASIC. [Application-specific standard products (ASSPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_standard_product) are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the [7400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series) or the [4000 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4000_series).

As feature sizes have shrunk and design tools improved over the years, the maximum complexity (and hence functionality) possible in an ASIC has grown from 5,000 gates to **over 100 million**. Modern ASICs often include entire microprocessors, memory blocks including ROM, RAM, EEPROM, flash memory and other large building blocks. Such an ASIC is often termed a **SoC** (system-on-chip). Designers of digital ASICs often use a hardware description language (HDL), such as **Verilog** or **VHDL**, to describe the functionality of ASICs.

<a href="{{ site.base-url }}/2016/06/03/hw-fpga.html">Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)</a> are the modern-day technology for building a [breadboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard) or prototype from standard parts; programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications. For smaller designs or lower production volumes, FPGAs may be more cost effective than an ASIC design even in production. The non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost of an ASIC can run into the millions of dollars.

# Cell libraries, IP-based design, hard and soft macros

Cell libraries of logical primitives are usually provided by the device manufacturer as part of the service. Although they will incur no additional cost, their release will be covered by the terms of a [non-disclosure agreement (NDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement) and they will be regarded as intellectual property by the manufacturer. Usually their physical design will be pre-defined so they could be termed **hard macros**.

What most engineers understand as "intellectual property" are [IP cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core), designs purchased from a third-party as sub-components of a larger ASIC. They may be provided as an HDL description (often termed a **soft macro**), or as a fully routed design that could be printed directly onto an ASIC's mask (often termed a **hard macro**). Many organizations now sell such pre-designed cores - CPUs, Ethernet, USB or telephone interfaces - and larger organizations may have an entire department or division to produce cores for the rest of the organization. Indeed, the wide range of functions now available is a result of the phenomenal improvement in electronics in the late 1990s and early 2000s; as a core takes a lot of time and investment to create, its re-use and further development cuts product cycle times dramatically and creates better products. Additionally, organizations such as **OpenCores** ([Home](http://www.opencores.org/), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCores)) are collecting free IP cores, paralleling the open source software movement in hardware design.

**Soft macros** are often process-independent (i.e. they can be fabricated on a wide range of manufacturing processes and different manufacturers). **Hard macros** are process-limited and usually further design effort must be invested to migrate (port) to a different process or manufacturer.
