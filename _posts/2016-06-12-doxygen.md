This article introduces the usage of Doxygen, and generates data structure for Linux kernel project.

# What's Doxygen?

[**Doxygen**](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.

Doxygen can help you in three ways:

* It can **generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) from a set of documented source files**. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.

* You can configure doxygen to **extract the code structure from undocumented source files**. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. Doxygen can also **visualize the relations between the various elements** by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.

* You can also use doxygen for **creating normal documentation**.

Doxygen is developed under Mac OS X and Linux, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.

# Install Doxygen

Run the following command to install Doxygen:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ sudo apt install doxygen
[sudo] password for chenwx:

The following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:
  python3-pycurl
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove it.
Suggested packages:
  doxygen-latex doxygen-doc doxygen-gui
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  doxygen

You can also install doxygen from source code if you like to do so, refer to [Doxygen Installation](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/install.html).

# Usage of Doxygen

According to [Getting started](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/starting.html), the following figure shows the relation between the tools and the flow of information between them:

And here is the steps of using Doxygen:

* Step 0: Check if doxygen supports your programming language
* Step 1: Creating a configuration file
* Step 2: Running doxygen
* Step 3: Documenting the sources

# Extract Data Structure for Linux Kernel

## Create Configuration File

```
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ mkdir -p linux_doxygen/config
chenwx@chenwx ~ $ cd linux_doxygen/config

chenwx@chenwx ~/linux_doxygen/config $ doxygen -s -g linux-kernel-config

Configuration file `linux-kernel-config' created.

Now edit the configuration file and enter

  doxygen linux-kernel-config

to generate the documentation for your project

chenwx@chenwx ~/linux_doxygen/config $ cp linux-kernel-config linux-kernel-config.original
chenwx@chenwx ~/linux_doxygen/config $ ll
-rw-rw-r-- 1 chenwx chenwx 11K Jun 12 07:28 linux-kernel-config
-rw-rw-r-- 1 chenwx chenwx 11K Jun 12 07:30 linux-kernel-config.original

chenwx@chenwx ~/linux_doxygen/config $ gedit linux-kernel-config &
```

Edit the configuration file *linux-kernel-config* and change the values of the following TAGs. Refer to [Doxygen Configuration](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/config.html) for more explanation of each TAG.

```
chenwx@chenwx ~/linux_doxygen/config $ diff linux-kernel-config*                   
11c11
< OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = /home/chenwx/linux_doxygen/output/
---
> OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       =

< OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES
---
> OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO
101c101

< DOT_NUM_THREADS        = 2
---
> DOT_NUM_THREADS        = 0
```

## Run Doxygen in Linux Kernel

Create output directory by command:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~/linux_doxygen $ mkdir output
```

Then, run Doxygen in directory *~/linux/kernel/* to check the data structure in Linux kernel:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~/linux $ doxygen ../linux_doxygen/config/linux-kernel-config
...

```

## Open Output in Browser

The output is generated in output directory *~/linux_doxygen/output*. Check the output by Firefox:

```
chenwx@chenwx ~/linux $ cd ../linux_doxygen/output/
chenwx@chenwx ~/linux_doxygen/output $ firefox html/index.html &
```

For instance, here is the data structure of *struct worker*:
