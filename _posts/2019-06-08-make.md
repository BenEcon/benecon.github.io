title:  "Make: A Build Automation Tool"
tag: Linux
toc: true
---

In software development, Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. Though integrated development environments and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

Besides building programs, Make can be used to manage any project where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.

# GNU Make

GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the **makefile**, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build and install the program.

# eMake

**Electric Make** (**eMake**), the main build application in ElectricAccelerator, is a new Make version invoked interactively or through build scripts. It reads makefiles in several different formats, including GNU Make and Microsoft NMAKE. Electric Make distributes commands to the cluster for remote execution and services file requests.
