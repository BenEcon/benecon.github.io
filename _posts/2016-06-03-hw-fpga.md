# What's FPGA?

A *Field-Programmable Gate Array* (**FPGA**) is an integrated circuit designed to be confidgured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing -- hence *field-programmable*. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a *Hardware Description Language* (**HDL**), similar to that used for an *Application-Specific Integrated Circuit* (**ASIC**). (*Circuit diagrams* were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare.)

**FPGAs** contain **an array of programmable logic blocks**, and **a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects** that allow the logic blocks to be *wired together*, like many logic gates that can be inter-wired in different configurations. Logic blocks can be configured to perform complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic gates like AND and XOR. *In most FPGAs, logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.*

*FPGAs are programmable semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) connected through programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be programmed to the desired application or functionality requirements. -- Xilinx*

## Composition of FPGA

* **CLB (Configurable Logic Block)**

    CLB contains clusters of LUTs, Registers, Arithmetic and other circuitry.

* **LUT (Look-UP Table)**

    LUT is a hardware implementation of a truth table.

## Types of FPGA

* One-Time Programmable (OTP) FPGAs
* SRAM-based FPGAs, which can be reprogrammed as the design evolves

## Hard Core & Soft Core

* **Hard Core**

    * Speed up to 1GHz+
    * Can achieve much faster processing speeds
    * Fixed and cannot be modified (dedicated silicon area on FPGA)
    * Examples: PowerPC used in Virtex-4/5, ARM Cortex-A9 dual-core MCU used in Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC from Xilinx
    <p/>

* **Soft Core**

    * Simple microcontroller/ful-fledged microprocessor
    * Less Speed around 250MHz & limited by the speed of the fabric
    * Can be easily modified and tuned to specific requirements, more features, custom instructions, etc
    * Example: LEON3, OpenRISC, MicroBlaze+PicoBlaze, **Nios II**
    <p/>

*A soft-core processor is a microprocessor fully described in softare, usually in an HDL, which can be synthesized in Programmable hardware, such as FPGAs.*

## Hardware Description Language (HDL)

* **Verilog HDL**

    IEEE Std. 1364-1995

* **VHDL**

    IEEE Std. 1076-1993

## Stratix series

The description of Stratix series FPGAs & SoCs can be found on [here](https://www.altera.com/products/fpga/stratix-series.html).

A **Stratix FPGA** can provide up to 80K logic elements (LEs) and 7.3 Mbits of on-chip RAM arranged in TriMatrix memory blocks, operating at up to 350 MHz. The Stratix FPGA supports external memory interfaces such as DDR SDRAM at 400 Mbps and QDRII SRAM at 800 Mbps. The Stratix FPGA also introduced the world's first digital signal processing (DSP) block, containing four 18 x 18 multipliers, accumulators, and a summation unit.

Building on the Stratix FPGA high-performance architectural features, the **Stratix GX FPGA** is the first programmable logic device to incorporate high-speed serial transceivers operating at multi-gigabit speeds. Using a transceiver block supporting four full-duplex channels and clock data recovery (CDR) technology allows transmission of data in excess of 3.1875-Gbps per channel. This data rate supports many common high-speed communication protocols including SerialLite, Gigabit Ethernet, 10-Gigabit Ethernet/XAUI, SONET/SDH, Fibre Channel, the Serial RapidIO® standard, PCI Express, SFI-5, and SPI-5.

## Embedded Development Flow

![Nios_II_System_Development_Flow](/assets/Nios_II_System_Development_Flow.png)

According to *Nios II Hardware Development Tutorial*, the Nios II development flow consists of three types of development:

* hardware design steps
* software design steps
* system design steps, which involves both hardware and software

For simpler Nios II systems, one person might perform all steps. For more complex systems, separate hardware and software designers might be responsible for different steps. System design steps involve both the hardware and software, and might require input from both sides. In the case of separate hardware and software teams, it is important to know exactly what files and information must be passed between teams at the points of intersection in the design flow.
