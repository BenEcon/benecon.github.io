# Organizations

## ITU

The [International Telecommunication Union (ITU)](http://www.itu.int), originally the **International Telegraph Union** formed in **1865**, is a specialized agency of the **United Nations** (UN) that is responsible for issues that concern **information and communication technologies**. ITU became a United Nations specialized agency in **1947**.

The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum, promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world, and assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical standards. The ITU is active in areas including broadband Internet, latest-generation wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, convergence in fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice, TV broadcasting, and next-generation networks.

ITU also organizes worldwide and regional exhibitions and forums, such as ITU TELECOM WORLD, bringing together representatives of government and the telecommunications and ICT industry to exchange ideas, knowledge and technology.

ITU, based in *Geneva, Switzerland*, is a member of the United Nations Development Group. ITU has been an intergovernmental public-private partnership organization since its inception. Its membership includes **193 Member States** and **around 700 public and private sector companies** as well as **international and regional telecommunication entities**, known as Sector Members and Associates, which undertake most of the work of each Sector.

The ITU comprises three sectors, each managing a different aspect of the matters handled by the Union, as well as **ITU TELECOM**. The sectors were created during the restructuring of ITU at its 1992 Plenipotentiary Conference.

| ITU sectors | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| **Radiocommunication** (**ITU-R**) | Established in 1927 as the International Radio Consultative Committee or **CCIR** (from its French name "Comité consultatif international pour la radio"), this sector manages the international radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbit resources. In 1992, the **CCIR** became the **ITU-R**. |
| **Standardization** (**ITU-T**) | Standardization was the original purpose of ITU since its inception. Established in 1956 as the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee or **CCITT** (from its French name "Comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique"), this sector standardizes global telecommunications (except for radio). In 1993, the **CCITT** became the **ITU-T**. |
| **Development** (**ITU-D**) | Established in 1992, this sector helps spread equitable, sustainable and affordable access to information and communication technologies (**ICT**). |
| **ITU TELECOM** | ITU TELECOM organizes major events for the world's ICT community. ITU Telecom World 2011 is ITU Telecom's 40th Anniversary with the first event in 1971. |

<p/>

A permanent General Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General, manages the day-to-day work of the Union and its sectors.

### WRC

The [World radiocommunication conferences (WRC)](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/conferences/wrc/Pages/default.aspx) are held **every three to four years**. It is the job of WRC to review, and, if necessary, revise the [Radio Regulations](#radio-regulations), the international treaty governing the use of the radio-frequency spectrum and the geostationary-satellite and non-geostationary-satellite orbits. Revisions are made on the basis of an agenda determined by the [ITU Council](http://www.itu.int/en/council), which takes into account recommendations made by previous world radiocommunication conferences.

The general scope of the agenda of world radiocommunication conferences (WRC) is established four to six years in advance, with the final agenda set by the ITU Council two years before the conference, with the concurrence of a majority of Member States.

Under the terms of the [ITU Constitution](http://www.itu.int/pub/S-CONF-PLEN/en), a WRC can:

* revise the [Radio Regulations](#radio-regulations) and any associated Frequency assignment and allotment Plans;
* address any radiocommunication matter of worldwide character;
* instruct the [Radio Regulations Board (RRB)](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/conferences/RRB/Pages/default.aspx) and the [Radiocommunication Bureau](http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/go/br/en), and review their activities;
* determine [Questions](http://www.itu.int/pub/R-QUE/en) for study by the [Radiocommunication Assembly (RA)](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/conferences/RA) and its [Study Groups](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups) in preparation for future Radiocommunication Conferences.

On the basis of contributions from administrations, the [Special Committee](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups), the Radiocommunication Study Groups, and other sources (see Article 19 of the Convention (Geneva, 1992)) concerning the regulatory, technical, operational and procedural matters to be considered by World and Regional Radiocommunication Conferences, the [Conference Preparatory Meeting (CPM)](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rcpm) shall prepare a consolidated report to be used in support of the work of such conferences.

Refer to [Complete List of Radio Conferences](http://www.itu.int/en/history/Pages/CompleteListOfRadioConferences.aspx) and [Calendar of Events ](http://www.itu.int/en/events/Pages/Calendar-Events.aspx) for a list of World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRC) in the past and in the future.

#### Radio Regulations

The [Radio Regulations](http://www.itu.int/pub/R-REG-RR/en) contains the complete texts as adopted by the World Radiocommunication Conference (Geneva, 1995) (WRC-95) and subsequently revised and adopted by World Radiocommunication Conferences, including all Appendices, Resolutions, Recommendations and ITU-R Recommendations incorporated by reference.

The Radio Regulations can be downloaded from [here](http://www.itu.int/pub/R-REG-RR/en).

## ETSI

The [European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)](http://www.etsi.org/) is an independent, not-for-profit, standardization organization in the telecommunications industry (equipment makers and network operators) in Europe, headquartered in *Sophia-Antipolis, France*, with worldwide projection. ETSI produces globally-applicable standards for Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), including fixed, mobile, radio, converged, broadcast and internet technologies.

ETSI was created by European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) in 1988 and is officially recognized by the European Commission (EC) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) secretariat. Based in Sophia Antipolis (France), ETSI is officially responsible for standardization of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) within Europe.

ETSI publishes between 2,000 and 2,500 standards every year. Since its establishment in **1988**, it produced over 30,000. These include the standards that enable key global technologies such as **GSM** cell phone system, **3G**, **4G**, **DECT** (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication), **TETRA** (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) professional mobile radio system, and **Short Range Device** requirements including LPD radio, smart cards and many more standards success stories.

Significant ETSI technical committees and Industry Specification Groups (ISGs) include SmartM2M (for machine-to-machine communications), Intelligent Transport Systems, Network Functions Virtualisation, Cyber Security, Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures etc. ETSI inspired the creation of, and is a partner in, **3GPP** and **oneM2M**. All technical committees, working and industry specification groups are accessible via the [ETSI Portal](#http://portal.etsi.org/).

ETSI technology clusters provide a simple, easy to grasp overview of ETSI’s activities in ICT standardization. Each technology cluster represents a major component of a global ICT architecture and covers the work of a number of ETSI technical committees and working groups that share a common technological scope and vision. The work of a single Technical Committee may be represented in several clusters. Clusters facilitate easy identification of an area of interest based on business relevance or application domain rather than purely on specific technical work areas.

ETSI is a founding partner organization of the [Global Standards Collaboration (GSC)](http://www.gsc.etsi.org) initiative.

## 3GPP

The [3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)](http://www.3gpp.org/) is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations, known as the Organizational Partners. The initial scope of 3GPP was to make a globally applicable third-generation (3G) mobile phone system specification based on evolved Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) specifications within the scope of the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) project of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The scope was later enlarged to include the development and maintenance of:

* **GSM** and related 2G and 2.5G standards including GPRS and EDGE
* **UMTS** and related 3G standards including HSPA
* **LTE** and related 4G standards
* An evolved IP Multimedia Subsystem (**IMS**) developed in an access independent manner

3GPP standardization encompasses **Radio**, **Core Network** and **Service** architecture. The project was established in **December 1998** and should not be confused with 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), which specifies standards for another 3G technology based on IS-95 (CDMA), commonly known as CDMA2000. The 3GPP support team (also known as the *Mobile Competence Centre*) is located at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) headquarters in Sophia-Antipolis (France).

## 3GPP2

The [3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2)](http://www.3gpp2.org/) is a collaboration between telecommunications associations to make a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone system specification within the scope of the **ITU's IMT-2000** project. In practice, **3GPP2 is the standardization group for CDMA2000**, the set of 3G standards based on the earlier **cdmaOne 2G CDMA** technology.

The participating associations are **ARIB/TTC** (Japan), **CCSA** (China Communications Standards Association, China), **TIA** (Telecommunications Industry Association, North America) and **TTA** (Telecommunications Technology Association, South Korea).

The agreement was established in **December 1998**.

**Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB)** was a 3GPP2 project to develop a fourth-generation successor to CDMA2000. In November 2008, Qualcomm, UMB's lead sponsor, announced it was ending development of the technology, favoring **LTE** instead, refer to [Qualcomm halts UMB project](#http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN1335969420081113?rpc=401&).

3GPP2 should not be confused with 3GPP; 3GPP is the standard body behind the **Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)** that is the 3G upgrade to GSM networks, while 3GPP2 is the standard body behind the competing 3G standard **CDMA2000** that is the 3G upgrade to **cdmaOne** networks used mostly in the United States (and to some extent also in Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and India).

**GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA** is the most widespread wireless standard in the world. A few countries (such as China, the United States, Canada, India, South Korea and Japan) use both sets of standards, but most countries use only the GSM family.

# Generations

## 0G (Mobile Radio Telephones)

**Mobile radio telephone** (or **0G**) systems preceded modern cellular mobile telephony technology. Since they were the predecessors of the first generation of cellular telephones, these systems are sometimes retroactively referred to as **pre cellular** (or sometimes **zero generation**) systems. Technologies used in **pre cellular** systems included the **Push to Talk** (PTT or manual), **Mobile Telephone System** (**MTS**), **Improved Mobile Telephone Service** (**IMTS**), and **Advanced Mobile Telephone System** (**AMTS**) systems. These early mobile telephone systems can be distinguished from earlier closed radiotelephone systems in that they were available as a commercial service that was part of the **Public Switched Telephone Network** (**PSTN**), with their own telephone numbers, rather than part of a closed network such as a police radio or taxi dispatch system.

These mobile telephones were usually mounted in **cars** or **trucks**, though briefcase models were also made. Typically, the transceiver (transmitter-receiver) was mounted in the vehicle trunk and attached to the "head" (dial, display, and handset) mounted near the driver seat.

Early examples for this technology:

| Systems | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| **MTS** (Mobile Telephone System) | ***Motorola*** in conjunction with the ***Bell System*** operated the first commercial mobile telephone service **Mobile Telephone System** (**MTS**) in the **US** in **1946**, as a service of the wireline telephone company. **MTS** was replaced by **Improved Mobile Telephone Service** (**IMTS**), introduced in 1964. |
| **A-Netz** | The **A-Netz** launched **1952** in **West Germany** as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network. |
| **MTA** (Mobiltelefonisystem A) | In **Sweden**, the first mobile phone system was **MTA** (Mobiltelefonisystem A), which was introduced in **1956**, and lasted until **1967**. It was a 160 MHz system available in Stockholm and Gothenburg, with 125 total subscribers. |
| **MTB** (Mobiltelefonisystem B) | In **Sweden**， the second system **MTB** (Mobiltelefonisystem B), had transistorized mobile sets, was introduced in **1962**, and lasted until **1983**. It operated in the 76-77.5 and 81-82.5 MHz bands, was also available in Malmö, and had around 600 subscribers. |
| **MTD** (Mobiltelefonisystem D) | **MTD** (Mobiltelefonisystem D) was a manual mobile phone system for the 450 MHz frequency band. It was introduced in **1971** in **Sweden**, and lasted until **1987**, when it was made obsolete by the **NMT** automatic service. The **MTD** network had 20,000 users at its peak, with 700 people employed as phone operators. |
| **System 1** | **System 1** launch in **1959** in the **UK**, the 'Post Office South Lancashire Radiophone Service', covering South Lancashire and operated from a telephone exchange in Manchester is cited as the country's first mobile phone network. However it was manual (needed to be connected via an operator) and with very little coverage for several decades. |
| **IMTS** (Improved Mobile Telephone Service) | First automatic system was the **Bell System's IMTS** which became available in **1962**, offering automatic dialing to and from the mobile. |
| **Altai** | **Altai** mobile telephone system was launched into the experimental service in 1963 in USSR, becoming fully operational in **1965**, a first automatic mobile phone system in **Europe**. |
| **OLT** (*Norwegian for* Offentlig Landmobil Telefoni) | The **Televerket** opened its first manual mobile telephone system in **Norway** in **1966**. Norway was later the first country in Europe to get an automatic mobile telephone system. |
| **ARP** (Autoradiopuhelin) | The **Autoradiopuhelin** (**ARP**) launched in **1971** in **Finland** as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network |
| **AMR** (Automatizovaný městský radiotelefon) | The **Automatizovaný městský radiotelefon** (**AMR**) launched in **1978**, fully operational in **1983**, in Czechoslovakia as the first analog mobile radio telephone in the whole Eastern Bloc. |
| **B-Netz** | The **B-Netz** launched **1972** in **West Germany** as the country's second public commercial mobile phone network (but the first one that did not require human operators to connect calls). |

## 1G

**1G** refers to the first generation of wireless telephone technology (mobile telecommunications). These are the **analog** telecommunications standards that were **introduced in the 1980s** and continued until being replaced by 2G digital telecommunications. The main difference between the two mobile telephone systems (1G and 2G), is that **the radio signals used by 1G networks are analog, while 2G networks are digital**.

Although both systems use digital signaling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the handsets) to the rest of the telephone system, the voice itself during a call is encoded to digital signals in 2G whereas 1G is only modulated to higher frequency, typically 150 MHz and up. The inherent advantages of digital technology over that of analog meant that 2G networks eventually replaced them almost everywhere.

Examples for this technology:

| Systems | Organization | Standardization | Family |
| :------ | :----------- | :-------------- | :----- |
| **AMPS** (Advanced Mobile Phone System) | **ANSI** | TIA/EIA/IS-3<br>ANSI/TIA/EIA-553 | AMPS |
| **N-AMPS** | **ANSI** | TIA/EIA/IS-91 | AMPS |
| **TACS** (Total Access Communication System) | | | AMPS |
| **ETACS** (Evolved Total Access Communication System) | | | AMPS |
| **NMT** (Nordic Mobile Telephone) | | | Other |
| **C-450** | | | Other |
| **Hicap** | | | Other |
| **Mobitex** | | | Other |
| **DataTAC** | | | Other |

## 2G (pre-IMT-2000)

Refer to <a href="{{ site.base-url }}/2016/03/13/telecom-itu-recommendations.html#pre-imt-2000-2g">Pre-IMT-2000 (2G)</a> for ITU-R Recommendations.

**2G** is short for second-generation wireless telephone technology. Second generation cellular telecommunication networks were commercially launched on the **GSM** standard in Finland by Radiolinja in **1991**. Three primary benefits of 2G networks over their predecessors were that:

* phone conversations were digitally encrypted;
* 2G systems were significantly more efficient on the spectrum allowing for far greater mobile phone penetration levels; and
* 2G introduced data services for mobile, starting with Short Message Service (SMS) text messages.

2G technologies enabled the various mobile phone networks to provide the services such as text messages, picture messages and MMS (Multi-Media Messages). All text messages sent over 2G are digitally encrypted, allowing for the transfer of data in such a way that only the intended receiver can receive and read it.

After 2G was launched, the previous mobile telephone systems were retroactively dubbed 1G. **While radio signals on 1G networks are analog, radio signals on 2G networks are digital**. Both systems use digital signalling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the handsets) to the rest of the telephone system.

2G has been superseded by newer technologies such as 2.5G, 2.75G, 3G, and 4G; however, 2G networks are still used in many parts of the world.
