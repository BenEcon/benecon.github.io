# Automotive Grade Linux (AGL)

[Automotive Grade Linux (AGL)](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) is a collaborative open source project that is bringing together automakers, suppliers and technology companies to accelerate the development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car. With Linux at its core, AGL is developing an open platform from the ground up that can serve as the de facto industry standard to enable rapid development of new features and technologies.

# Tizen

[Tizen](https://www.tizen.org/) is an open and flexible operating system built from the ground up to address the needs of all stakeholders of the mobile and connected device ecosystem, including device manufacturers, mobile operators, application developers and independent software vendors (ISVs). Tizen is developed by a community of developers, under open source governance, and is open to all members who wish to participate.

# Apple CarPlay

Available on select cars, [CarPlay](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/) is a smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car. CarPlay takes the things you want to do with your iPhone while driving and puts them right on your car’s built-in display. You can get directions, make calls, send and receive messages, and listen to music, all in a way that allows you to stay focused on the road. Just connect your iPhone and go.

Every major automobile manufacturer has partnered with us in supporting CarPlay. There are over 400 models to choose from, with more on the way. Refer to [Apple CarPlay Available Models](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/).

# Android Auto

[Android Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/) is a simpler way to use your phone in the car. Whether on your phone screen or on your car display, Android Auto was designed with safety and convenience in mind. With larger touch targets, a simplified interface, and your Google Assistant, it’s designed to minimize distraction so you can stay focused on the road.

# MirrorLink

[MirrorLink](https://mirrorlink.com/) turns the promise of the connected car into reality. Simply connect any [MirrorLink-enabled smartphone](https://mirrorlink.com/phones) to any [MirrorLink-enabled vehicle](https://mirrorlink.com/cars), and take advantage of easier and more responsible access to navigation, music and phone apps while you drive. The apps run on the smartphone, but you see them on the dashboard display and hear the audio via the car's speakers.
